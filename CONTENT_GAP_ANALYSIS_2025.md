- High-stakes decisions affecting business folks (not just engineers)
- $1M+ impact threshold for revenue/cost savings

**L7 Requirements:**
- Cross-functional specialist with organizational influence
- Bar Raiser training strongly encouraged
- Examples of industry-level impact
- Strategic initiatives spanning multiple quarters
- Multi-million dollar decision authority

#### Most Misunderstood Leadership Principle
**"Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit"**
- Common misconception: Standing ground and doing it your way
- Reality: Verbalizing disagreement, then committing to group decision
- Stakes must be high enough to affect business outcomes
- 2-4 minute answer length is optimal (not too short, not boring)

#### Bar Raiser Strategy Insights
- Senior-level Amazon employees at top of interviewer hierarchy
- Toughest and most-trained interviewers
- Independent evaluator with veto power
- Focus on follow-up questions and depth probing
- Cannot be influenced by hiring team

### Answer Structure Requirements
**Critical Timing Guidelines:**
- 2-4 minutes per behavioral answer
- 4 minutes maximum to avoid listener fatigue
- Balance detail with opportunity for follow-ups
- Use STAR as filter, not primary structure

### Platform Feature Gaps vs Competitors

#### What Top Platforms Offer:
- **Pramp/Exponent**: 5 free peer mock interviews/month, $79/month unlimited
- **Interviewing.io**: $225/session with FAANG engineers, anonymous practice
- **DesignGurus.io**: Ex-FAANG engineer mock interviews with detailed feedback
- **LeetCode**: Amazon-specific problem tags and timed interview simulation

#### Missing Interactive Features:
- AI-powered mock interviewer
- Video recording and playback
- Peer matching for practice
- Real-time collaborative coding
- Automated feedback generation

## Conclusion

SystemCraft has a strong foundation but needs critical enhancements to maintain market leadership. The identified gaps represent both risks (candidates failing due to missing prep) and opportunities (unique differentiation). 

The most critical gaps are:
1. **Written assessment preparation** (completely missing)
2. **Generative AI and ML system design** (limited coverage)
3. **Bar Raiser deep strategy** (insufficient depth)
4. **Interactive mock interview platform** (no practice tools)
5. **L6/L7 behavioral differentiation** (needs clearer stakes/impact guidance)

Implementing these recommendations will position SystemCraft as the definitive resource for Amazon L6/L7 Engineering Manager preparation, with expected improvements in candidate success rates and platform engagement.

The total implementation timeline of 10 weeks would transform SystemCraft into a comprehensive, modern, and highly effective preparation platform that addresses all aspects of the current Amazon L6/L7 interview process.
