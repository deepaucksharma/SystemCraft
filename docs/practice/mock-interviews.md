## üé≠ Diverse Interviewer Personalities and Adaptation Strategies

### The Five Core Interviewer Archetypes

Understanding and adapting to different interviewer personalities is crucial for interview success. Each type requires different response strategies and communication approaches.

#### 1. The Detail-Oriented Technical Expert

**Personality Profile:**
- Deep technical background, often principal engineer or architect
- Values precision, accuracy, and technical depth
- Asks follow-up questions about implementation details
- May challenge technical assumptions or probe edge cases
- Appreciates candidates who can "go deep" on technical topics

**Interview Style and Approach:**
```markdown
**Communication Pattern:**
- Asks very specific technical questions
- Wants to see working code or detailed architectures
- Probes for understanding of trade-offs and alternatives
- May ask about performance, scalability, and edge cases
- Values technical accuracy over high-level vision

**Sample Dialogue:**
Interviewer: "You mentioned using Redis for caching. What's your eviction policy?"
Candidate: "I'd use LRU eviction policy for this use case because..."
Interviewer: "What about memory overhead? Have you considered the memory efficiency of Redis vs Memcached for this scenario?"
Candidate: "That's a great point. Let me walk through the memory footprint analysis..."

**Follow-up Probes:**
- "Can you write the actual code for that algorithm?"
- "What's the time complexity of your solution?"
- "How would you handle race conditions in this design?"
- "What monitoring would you add to detect this issue?"
```
