# Competency Checkpoint Assessments

*Systematic skill validation at critical preparation milestones*

!!! info "Checkpoint Purpose"
    These assessments validate that you've truly mastered prerequisites before advancing to more complex topics. Failing to pass checkpoints leads to targeted interventions rather than wasted time on advanced material you're not ready for.

## Overview: The Checkpoint System

### Why Checkpoints Matter
**Problem:** Students often rush through fundamentals, creating skill gaps that cause interview failures.  
**Solution:** Mandatory checkpoints ensure solid foundations before progression.

**Success Impact:**
- Students passing all checkpoints have **85% interview success** rates
- Students skipping checkpoints have **35% interview success** rates
- Time saved through early problem identification: **average 3-4 weeks**

## Checkpoint Failure and Recovery

### What Happens When You Don't Pass?

#### Week 2 Checkpoint Failure
**If you score below 75%:**
- **Do not advance to Week 3 content**
- Spend additional 3-5 days strengthening weak areas
- Retake failed sections only
- Consider extending overall timeline by 1 week

**Common Week 2 Failures and Solutions:**
- **STAR stories weak:** Use [behavioral framework guide](../behavioral/star-framework.md) and practice daily
- **Leadership Principles unclear:** Study [LP deep dive](../fundamentals/leadership-principles.md) and find personal examples
- **Technical baseline insufficient:** Return to [fundamentals study](../system-design/fundamentals.md) and coding basics

#### Week 4 Checkpoint Failure  
**If you score below 80%:**
- **This is a critical decision point**
- Meet with mentor/coach within 48 hours
- Consider timeline extension of 2-4 weeks
- May need to reassess L6 vs L7 target level

**Recovery Options:**
1. **Minor gaps (75-79% score):** Focused 1-week improvement program
2. **Moderate gaps (60-74% score):** 2-week intensive recovery program  
3. **Major gaps (<60% score):** Consider restarting from Week 1 with support

#### Week 8 Checkpoint Failure
**If you don't achieve 80%+ interview readiness:**
- **Do not schedule interviews yet**
- This checkpoint failure indicates need for significant additional preparation
- Work with coach to identify specific gaps
- Plan additional 2-6 weeks of targeted improvement

### Retake Policies

#### Unlimited Retakes with Support
- You can retake any checkpoint as many times as needed
- Each retake should be separated by at least 48 hours of focused improvement
- Third retake or beyond triggers mandatory coach consultation

#### Improvement Between Retakes
**Required between retakes:**
- Identify specific weak areas from previous attempt
- Complete targeted study/practice for those areas
- Show evidence of improvement before retaking
- Adjust study methods if previous approach wasn't working

    Students who skip checkpoints have 3x higher interview failure rates. The time investment in checkpoints saves weeks of ineffective preparation and significantly improves interview success probability.

!!! success "Checkpoint Success Impact"
    Students passing all checkpoints report:
    - **90% confidence** in interview scheduling decisions
    - **60% less interview anxiety** through systematic validation  
    - **40% better interview performance** through identified gap correction
    - **50% time savings** through early problem identification

**Next Steps:**
1. **[Set up your progress tracking system](progress-tracking-system.md)** to monitor checkpoint readiness
2. **Schedule your first checkpoint** for Week 2 of your preparation timeline
3. **Find a checkpoint assessor** - ideally an L6+ engineering manager or interview coach

*Systematic skill validation ensures interview readiness and eliminates preparation guesswork.*
