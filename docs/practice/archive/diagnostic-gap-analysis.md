```

## Detailed Gap Analysis by Area

### Behavioral Leadership Gap Analysis

#### Diagnostic Questions for STAR Stories
```markdown
**Story Structure Diagnostic:**
1. When you tell a STAR story, do listeners:
   □ Ask "So what was your specific role?" → TASK clarity gap
   □ Ask "What exactly did you do?" → ACTION specificity gap  
   □ Ask "What was the impact?" → RESULT quantification gap
   □ Seem engaged throughout → No structure gap

**Business Impact Diagnostic:**
2. In your STAR stories, can you:
   □ Yes/No: Name specific metrics and numbers?
   □ Yes/No: Explain why this mattered to the business?
   □ Yes/No: Show before/after comparison with data?
   □ Yes/No: Connect your actions to business outcomes?

**Leadership Depth Diagnostic:**
3. Your behavioral examples show:
   □ Participation in team activities → Participation gap
   □ Leading small initiatives → Leadership scope gap
   □ Cross-functional influence → Good leadership depth
   □ Organizational transformation → L7-level leadership
```

#### Behavioral Gap Analysis Results
```python
def diagnose_behavioral_gaps(responses):
    gaps = []
    
    if responses['structure_issues']:
        gaps.append({
            'type': 'story_structure',
            'severity': 'foundational',
            'intervention': 'return_to_star_framework_basics'
        })
    
    if not responses['quantified_impact']:
        gaps.append({
            'type': 'business_context',
            'severity': 'moderate',
            'intervention': 'business_impact_workshop'
        })
    
    if responses['leadership_level'] < target_level:
        gaps.append({
            'type': 'leadership_scope',
            'severity': 'critical_for_level',
            'intervention': 'experience_development_needed'
        })
    
    return gaps
```

## Automated Gap Detection System

### Daily Gap Detection (5 minutes)
```markdown
**After each study session, quickly assess:**

**Learning Quality Check:**
□ Did I understand new material or just memorize?
□ Can I explain today's concepts to someone else?  
□ Did I connect new learning to previous knowledge?
□ Do I feel more confident or more confused?

**Performance Quality Check:**
□ Did I maintain consistency with yesterday's performance?
□ Were any struggles due to knowledge gaps vs performance issues?
□ Did I handle mistakes and uncertainty gracefully?
□ Am I maintaining authentic leadership presence?

**Progress Quality Check:**  
□ Did I make meaningful progress on priority areas?
□ Am I on track for weekly and checkpoint goals?
□ Do I need to adjust approach or seek additional support?
□ Is my confidence building systematically?
```

**Knowledge Gap Assessment:**
1. What topics am I avoiding or struggling to understand?
2. Where do I feel uncertain despite study time invested?
3. What concepts can't I explain clearly to others?
4. Where do I rely on memorization vs understanding?

**Performance Gap Assessment:**
1. What's my consistency pattern in mock interviews?
2. Where does my performance break down under pressure?
3. What mistakes do I make repeatedly?
4. How well do I recover from errors or uncertainty?

**Integration Gap Assessment:**
1. How smooth are my transitions between interview types?
2. Do I maintain consistent leadership presence throughout?
3. Can I naturally combine technical depth with business context?
4. Does my authentic self come through regardless of topic?

**Based on patterns, implement targeted interventions immediately**
```

### Monthly Deep Diagnostic (30 minutes)
```markdown
**Comprehensive gap analysis with intervention planning:**

**Gap Pattern Recognition:**
- Review 4 weeks of daily and weekly gap assessments
- Identify recurring themes and persistent challenges
- Analyze correlation between study methods and outcomes
- Evaluate effectiveness of previous interventions

- Is this foundational (affects everything) or specific (isolated topic)?
- Is this individual skill issue or integration/combination issue?
- Is this technique issue or confidence/psychological issue?

**Intervention Planning:**
- Select appropriate intervention based on gap type and root cause
- Set specific timeline and success metrics for intervention  
- Identify support resources needed (mentor, coach, study partner)
- Plan reassessment method to validate intervention effectiveness

- [ ] Identify the #1 blocking issue preventing progress
- [ ] Eliminate all non-essential study activities
- [ ] Seek mentor/coach consultation within 48 hours

**Week 2: Intensive Gap Resolution**  
- [ ] Focus exclusively on identified blocking issue
- [ ] Use multiple learning modalities simultaneously
- [ ] Daily progress check-ins with accountability partner
- [ ] Adjust timeline expectations realistically

**Week 3: Validation and Re-entry**
- [ ] Test gap resolution with checkpoint-style assessment

- [ ] Plan realistic timeline based on actual progress capability
```

### When Multiple Gaps Are Overwhelming
```markdown
**Triage Approach:**
1. **Identity Crisis Gaps First** - Issues affecting all areas (confidence, time management)
2. **Foundation Gaps Second** - Missing basics that prevent all advanced learning  
3. **Integration Gaps Third** - Combination issues once individual skills are solid
4. **Polish Gaps Last** - Fine-tuning and optimization when fundamentals are strong

**Never attempt to solve all gaps simultaneously - prioritize and sequence systematically**
