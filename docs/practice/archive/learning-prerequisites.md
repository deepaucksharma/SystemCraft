## Common Prerequisite Violations and Fixes

### Skipping STAR Framework Mastery
**Problem:** Students rush into story development without understanding framework  
**Symptoms:** Weak stories, unclear structure, missing business impact  
**Fix:** Return to Behavioral Level 1, complete framework exercises

### Weak Technical Fundamentals  
**Problem:** Students attempt medium problems without mastering easy patterns  
**Symptoms:** Struggle with medium problems, inconsistent performance, stress under time pressure  
**Fix:** Return to Technical Level 1, complete pattern mastery

### Premature Mock Interview Practice
**Problem:** Students start mock interviews before building adequate story portfolio  
**Symptoms:** Low mock interview scores, high anxiety, inconsistent performance  
**Fix:** Complete Behavioral Level 2 before regular mock interview practice

### Integration Attempts Without Foundation
**Problem:** Students try to integrate technical and behavioral before mastering each individually  
**Symptoms:** Weak performance in both areas, confused messaging, lack of authentic presence  
**Fix:** Return to individual skill building, achieve Level 2 in both before integration
