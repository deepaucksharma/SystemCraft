# Complete Practice Framework for Amazon L6/L7 Success

!!! success "Comprehensive Practice Strategy"
    This complete practice framework provides structured preparation across all interview dimensions - behavioral, system design, and coding - specifically tailored for L6/L7 engineering manager roles at Amazon.

## =� Complete Practice Framework Overview

### 1. L6/L7 Practice Philosophy

#### Practice Principles for Engineering Manager Interviews
```markdown
**Quality Over Quantity:**
- 50 well-practiced stories better than 200 mediocre ones
- Deep understanding of 20 system design patterns vs surface knowledge of 100
- Mastery of core coding patterns vs attempting advanced algorithms

**Real-World Relevance:**
- Practice with scenarios you'll actually face as an L6/L7 manager
- Focus on examples from your actual experience and career
- Emphasize practical application over theoretical perfection

**Integrated Practice:**
- Combine behavioral, technical, and leadership elements in practice
- Practice explaining technical decisions through leadership principles
- Integrate customer impact into all technical discussions
```
