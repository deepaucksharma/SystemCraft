### Example 1: DynamoDB vs RDS for High-Throughput Systems

#### Real Interview Question (L6 Technical Round)
> "You need to design a system requiring 100,000 QPS with single-digit millisecond latency. Walk me through choosing between DynamoDB and RDS."

#### L6 Level Response Framework
```python
# L6 Approach: Systematic comparison with implementation details

class DatabaseDecisionFramework:
    def __init__(self, requirements):
        self.qps_requirement = 100000
        self.latency_requirement = "single-digit ms"
        self.consistency_needs = requirements.consistency
        self.query_patterns = requirements.queries
        
    def analyze_options(self):
        return {
            "dynamodb": self.evaluate_dynamodb(),
            "rds": self.evaluate_rds(),
            "recommendation": self.make_recommendation()
        }
    
    def evaluate_dynamodb(self):
        return {
            "latency": "1-4ms P99 (meets requirement)",
            "throughput": "Scales to millions of QPS",
            "consistency": "Eventually consistent by default",
            "cost": "$0.25 per million requests",
            "operations": "Managed service, auto-scaling",
            "limitations": "Limited query patterns, NoSQL learning curve"
        }
    
    def evaluate_rds(self):
        return {
            "latency": "10-50ms typical (may not meet requirement)",
            "throughput": "10K-50K QPS with read replicas",
            "consistency": "Strong consistency available",
            "cost": "$2000+/month for required scale",
            "operations": "More operational overhead",
            "limitations": "Complex sharding needed for scale"
        }
```

#### Specific Implementation Approach
```
SITUATION: E-commerce product catalog with 100K QPS reads
- Peak traffic during flash sales
- Product information changes infrequently
- Need global availability

MY ANALYSIS:
1. Latency Requirement: DynamoDB 1-4ms vs RDS 10-50ms
2. Scale: DynamoDB auto-scales vs RDS manual sharding
3. Query Patterns: Simple key-value lookups (perfect for DynamoDB)
4. Consistency: Product info can be eventually consistent

DECISION: DynamoDB with DAX caching
- Primary: DynamoDB with partition key as product_id
- Caching: DAX for sub-millisecond reads
- Global: Global Tables for multi-region
- Cost: 70% less than equivalent RDS solution

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Partition key design for even distribution
- GSI for category browsing
- TTL for temporary promotional data
- CloudWatch monitoring for hot partitions
```

#### Follow-up Handling
**Interviewer:** "What if you need complex queries later?"

**Strong Response:**
```
"I'd design a hybrid approach:
1. Keep DynamoDB for high-frequency reads (product details)
2. Add OpenSearch for complex queries (search, filtering)
3. Use DynamoDB Streams to sync data to OpenSearch
4. Route queries based on pattern - simple gets to DynamoDB, 
   complex searches to OpenSearch

This maintains the low-latency requirement while enabling 
complex analytics."
```

## üîß Implementation Patterns Library

### Pattern 1: Circuit Breaker Implementation

```python
class CircuitBreakerPattern:
    """Production-ready circuit breaker for external service calls"""
    
    def __init__(self, service_name, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.service_name = service_name
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
        
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute function with circuit breaker protection"""
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if self._should_attempt_reset():
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError(f"{self.service_name} circuit breaker is OPEN")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()

        self.state = "CLOSED"
        
    def _on_failure(self):
        """Handle failure and potentially open circuit"""
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()
        
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = "OPEN"
            logger.warning(f"Circuit breaker OPENED for {self.service_name}")
```

### Pattern 2: Retry with Exponential Backoff

    def execute(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute function with retry logic"""
        last_exception = None
        
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries + 1):

                delay = self._calculate_delay(attempt)
                logger.info(f"Retry attempt {attempt + 1} after {delay}s delay")
                time.sleep(delay)
        
        raise last_exception
    
    def _calculate_delay(self, attempt):
        """Calculate delay with exponential backoff and jitter"""
        delay = min(self.base_delay * (2 ** attempt), self.max_delay)
        
        if self.jitter:
            delay *= (0.5 + random.random() * 0.5)  # ¬±25% jitter
            
        return delay
    
    def _is_retryable_error(self, error):
        """Determine if error is worth retrying"""
        retryable_errors = [
            ConnectionError,

        ]
        return any(isinstance(error, err_type) for err_type in retryable_errors)
```

### Pattern 3: Database Connection Pool Management

```python
class DatabaseConnectionPool:
    """Production database connection pooling with monitoring"""
    
    def __init__(self, connection_string, pool_size=20, max_overflow=10):
        self.engine = create_engine(
            connection_string,
            pool_size=pool_size,
            max_overflow=max_overflow,
            pool_timeout=30,
            pool_recycle=3600,  # Recycle connections every hour
            pool_pre_ping=True  # Validate connections before use
        )
        self.pool_metrics = ConnectionPoolMetrics()
    
    @contextmanager
    def get_connection(self):
        """Get database connection with proper resource management"""

        connection = None
        
        try:
            connection = self.engine.connect()
            self.pool_metrics.record_checkout(time.time() - start_time)
            yield connection
        except Exception as e:
            self.pool_metrics.record_error(type(e).__name__)
            raise
        finally:
            if connection:
                connection.close()
                self.pool_metrics.record_checkin()
    
    def get_pool_status(self):
        """Monitor pool health and performance"""
        pool = self.engine.pool
        return {
            "size": pool.size(),
            "checked_in": pool.checkedin(),
