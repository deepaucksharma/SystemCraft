- **Preparation Time:** 3 months
- **Interview Date:** November 2024
- **Result:** Offer accepted

### The Journey

#### Month 1: Foundation Building

**Key Actions:**
- Created 20 STAR stories from my tech lead experiences
- Studied "The Everything Store" and "Working Backwards"
- Completed 50 LeetCode problems to refresh coding skills

#### Month 2: Deep Dive Preparation

**Key Actions:**
- Practiced 15 system design problems at both L6 and L7 scale
- Conducted 8 mock interviews with PrepTech coaches
- Rewrote all STAR stories to emphasize leadership and impact

#### Month 3: Final Polish

- Created a one-page "achievement summary" for quick reference

### The Interview Loop

#### Phone Screen (Technical + Behavioral)
**Question Asked:** "Design a distributed task scheduler"

**Behavioral:** "Tell me about a time you had to deliver a project with unclear requirements"
> "I used my story about leading the migration project where requirements changed three times. Emphasized customer obsession and bias for action."

#### Loop Day Breakdown

- Key Question: "How would you build a team from scratch?"
- My Approach: Discussed my framework for hiring, including diversity strategy and culture fit assessment

**Interview 2: System Design**

- Deep Dive: Spent 15 minutes on data consistency and real-time vs batch processing trade-offs

**Interview 3: Bar Raiser (Behavioral)**

4. **Data-Driven Answers:** Always included metrics and measurable outcomes

#### What I'd Do Differently

- **Negotiation:** Pushed RSU to $320K by showing competing offers
- **Final Package:** $185K base, $320K RSU, $100K sign-on (Year 1)

## Rejection Story: Learning from Failure

**Profile:** L5 SDM at Amazon â†’ Rejected for Senior Engineering Manager (L6) role (different org)

### Background
- **Current Role:** L5 SDM at Amazon (2 years)
- **Preparation Time:** 4 weeks
- **Interview Date:** October 2024
- **Result:** Rejected (with detailed feedback)

### What Went Wrong

#### Insufficient Preparation
> "I thought being an internal candidate would be an advantage. I underestimated the preparation needed."

#### The Fatal Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Weak System Design**
- Question: "Design a video streaming platform"
- What I Did: Jumped too quickly into implementation details
- What I Should Have Done: Spent more time on requirements gathering and high-level architecture

**Mistake #2: Recycled Internal Stories**
> "I used too many examples from my current role at Amazon. The interviewers wanted to see breadth of experience."

**Mistake #3: Poor Time Management**
- Spent too much time on one story
- Rushed through the technical discussion
- Didn't leave time for questions

### Feedback Received

#### Bar Raiser Feedback
- "Candidate showed good customer obsession but lacked depth in Dive Deep principle"
- "Stories were relevant but lacked quantifiable business impact"
- "Would benefit from more complex technical scenarios"

#### Hiring Manager Feedback
- "Strong cultural fit but needs more evidence of strategic thinking"
- "Good tactical execution but missing L6-level scope"

### The Comeback Plan

#### 3-Month Improvement Plan
1. **Month 1:** Technical depth
   - Complete system design course
   - Practice 20 system design problems
   - Build side project demonstrating scale

2. **Month 2:** Leadership stories
   - Develop stories from previous roles
   - Quantify all impacts
   - Practice with external mock interviewers

3. **Month 3:** Integration
   - Weekly mock interviews
   - Refine story delivery
   - Build confidence

### Lessons Learned
1. **Internal â‰  Easier:** Internal transfers are held to the same high bar
2. **Fresh Perspectives Matter:** Use diverse examples from entire career
3. **Practice is Non-Negotiable:** Even experienced Amazonians need preparation
4. **Feedback is Gold:** Detailed feedback helped identify specific gaps

### Update: Reapplication Success
> "I reapplied 8 months later to a different team. This time, I prepared for 3 months and received an L6 offer. The rejection was the best thing that happened - it forced me to truly prepare."
