## 🎯 Interview Focus & Strategy Quotes

### Behavioral vs Technical Balance

**L6 Candidate (Successful):**
> "Amazon prioritized leadership questions over coding. Out of 6 rounds, only 1 was pure coding. The rest had significant behavioral components."

**Bar Raiser:**
> "Pure Leadership Principles, no technical. We spent 60 minutes diving deep into specific scenarios where the candidate demonstrated ownership and customer obsession."

**L7 Candidate (Successful):**
> "L7 loops are up to 70% behavioral with VP-level strategic discussions. Technical competence is assumed; they're evaluating leadership potential."

### Management & Leadership Insights

**L7 Wisdom from June 2024:**
> "Soft skills are everything in people management. Empathy. Empathy. Empathy. Technical skills get you the interview, but empathy gets you the job."

**L6 to L7 Promotion:**
> "The leap from L6 to L7 isn't about managing more people—it's about thinking in systems and influencing across organizational boundaries."

### Preparation Philosophy

> "The stars must align, but preparation matters more than luck. I failed the first time because I underestimated the behavioral preparation needed."

**Applied Scientist:**
> "HM rounds are 50% technical, 50% management. Be ready to switch between system architecture and team building strategies seamlessly."

## 🚀 Coding & Technical Quotes

### Coding Interview Reality

**L7 Candidate:**
> "They don't ask you to code unless you give a super optimal solution approach. If you can't articulate the approach clearly, they'll test your implementation skills."

> "Focus on getting good enough to pass coding, but master system design and behavioral. The coding bar is table stakes; the real differentiation happens elsewhere."

> "Coming from IC, I over-prepared for coding and under-prepared for leadership scenarios. The coding questions were easier than I expected, but the people management scenarios were brutal."

> "Quantify everything. They asked for follow-up metrics on every story. Have backup numbers for your backup stories."
