- **[Amazon Top 100](amazon-top-100.md)** - Amazon-specific problem collection
- **[Problem Patterns](patterns.md)** - Essential coding patterns
- **[Algorithms Guide](algorithms.md)** - Core algorithmic knowledge

### Recommended Mock Platforms
- **Pramp** - Free peer-to-peer mock interviews
- **Interviewing.io** - Professional mock interviews with feedback
- **CodeSignal** - Amazon-style assessments
- **LeetCode Mock Assessments** - Timed problem sets

### Manager-Level Mock Focus

**Problem Difficulty**: 
- **L6**: Easy to Medium problems, emphasis on clean code and explanation
- **L7**: Medium problems, focus on system thinking and optimization

**Time Expectations**:
- **Setup & Understanding**: 3-5 minutes
- **Coding**: 15-20 minutes
- **Testing & Optimization**: 5-10 minutes
- **Discussion**: 5-10 minutes

## üìö What This Collection Will Include

When completed, this mock problem set will feature:

- **Level-Specific Problems**: Separate tracks for L6 and L7 expectations
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Problems that mirror actual Amazon interview experiences
- **Manager Context**: Problems that test architectural thinking, not just coding
- **Solution Templates**: Standard approaches and code quality expectations
- **Interview Simulation**: Complete mock interview scripts with follow-up questions
- **Evaluation Criteria**: How your performance will be assessed
- **Time Management**: Realistic pacing for 45-minute coding sessions

## üí° Mock Interview Tips

For immediate mock interview preparation:

1. **Practice explanation skills** - Describe your approach before coding
2. **Focus on clean code** - Readable, well-structured solutions
3. **Test your code** - Walk through examples and edge cases
4. **Discuss trade-offs** - Time/space complexity and alternative approaches
5. **Stay calm under pressure** - Practice with timer and live observers
