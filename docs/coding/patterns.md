## 2. Top 10 Patterns with Comprehensive Examples

### Pattern 1: Two Pointers

#### When to Recognize This Pattern:
- Searching pairs in sorted arrays
- Palindrome problems
- Array/string optimization requiring O(n) instead of O(n²)
- Problems involving comparison from opposite ends

#### Template Code:
```python
def two_pointers_template(arr, target):
    """
    Generic two pointers template for L6/L7 managers
    Focus: Clear logic, maintainable code
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current = process(arr[left], arr[right])
        
        if current == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current < target:
            left += 1  # Need larger value
        else:
            right -= 1  # Need smaller value
    
    return []  # No solution found
```

#### Amazon Interview Problems:

**Problem 1: Container With Most Water (Medium)**
```python
def max_area(height):
    """
    Amazon: Design a water container optimization system
    Manager insight: Resource optimization under constraints
    """
    max_water = 0
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        # Calculate current area
        width = right - left
        current_height = min(height[left], height[right])
        current_area = width * current_height
        max_water = max(max_water, current_area)
        
        # Move pointer with smaller height
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return max_water

# Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
# Manager discussion: Similar to load balancing optimization
```

**Problem 2: 3Sum (Medium)**
```python
def three_sum(nums):
    """
    Amazon: Find all unique triplets that sum to zero
    Manager insight: Duplicate detection and systematic enumeration
    """
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        # Skip duplicates for first element
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue
        
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            
            if current_sum == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                
                # Skip duplicates
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left+1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right-1]:
                    right -= 1
                
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif current_sum < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    
    return result

# Time: O(n²), Space: O(1) excluding output
# Manager discussion: Systematic approach to complex constraint problems
```

    # Fixed window size
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum
    
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        # Slide window: remove left, add right
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i-k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    
    return max_sum

def variable_sliding_window(s, condition):
    """
    Variable window template for constraint-based problems
    """
    left = 0
    best_result = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Expand window
        add_to_window(s[right])
        
        # Contract window while condition violated
        while window_violates_condition():
            remove_from_window(s[left])
            left += 1
        
        # Update result if current window is better
        best_result = max(best_result, right - left + 1)
    
    return best_result
```

    char_index = {}
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # If character seen before and within current window
        if s[right] in char_index and char_index[s[right]] >= left:
            left = char_index[s[right]] + 1
        
        char_index[s[right]] = right
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

        window_counts[char] += 1
        
        if char in required and window_counts[char] == required[char]:
            formed += 1
        
        # Contract window
        while formed == required_length and left <= right:
            # Update minimum window if smaller
            if right - left + 1 < min_len:
                min_len = right - left + 1
                min_left = left
            
            # Remove leftmost character
            char = s[left]
            window_counts[char] -= 1
            if char in required and window_counts[char] < required[char]:
                formed -= 1

### Pattern 7: Backtracking

#### When to Recognize This Pattern:
- Generate all possible solutions
- Problems with constraints and choices
- Permutations, combinations, subsets
- Puzzle solving with valid/invalid states

#### Template Code:
```python
def backtrack_template(candidates, path, result):
    """
    Generic backtracking template
    L6/L7 focus: Systematic exploration of solution space
    """
    # Base case: found valid solution
    if is_valid_solution(path):
        result.append(path[:])  # Make copy
        return
    
    # Try each candidate
    for candidate in candidates:
        if is_valid_choice(candidate, path):
            # Make choice
            path.append(candidate)
            
            # Recurse with updated state
            backtrack_template(get_next_candidates(candidates, candidate), 
                             path, result)
            
            # Backtrack (undo choice)

## 4. Manager-Specific Coding Strategies

### Communicating While Coding

**The L6/L7 Communication Framework:**

1. **Pattern Declaration** (30 seconds)
   ```
   "This looks like a [PATTERN] problem because [REASON].
   I'm going to use [APPROACH] which will give us [COMPLEXITY]."
   ```

2. **Structure Explanation** (1 minute)
   ```
   "My approach will be:
   1. [HIGH-LEVEL STEP 1]
   2. [HIGH-LEVEL STEP 2]  
   3. [HIGH-LEVEL STEP 3]
   This maps to our [REAL-WORLD ANALOGY]."
   ```

3. **Implementation Narration** (During coding)
   ```
   "Now I'm implementing [SPECIFIC PART] which handles [PURPOSE].
   This edge case matters because [REASON]."
   ```

4. **Optimization Discussion** (End)
   ```
   "Alternative approaches include [OPTION 1] and [OPTION 2].
   I chose this because [TRADE-OFF REASONING].
   In production, we'd also consider [OPERATIONAL CONCERNS]."
   ```

### Balancing Correctness vs Optimization

**The Manager's Priority Framework:**

1. **Correctness First** (60% of time)
   - Get working solution with clear logic
   - Handle basic edge cases
   - Demonstrate systematic thinking

2. **Communication Second** (25% of time)
   - Explain approach clearly
   - Connect to real-world problems
   - Show strategic understanding

3. **Optimization Third** (15% of time)
   - Improve time/space complexity if time permits
   - Discuss alternative approaches
   - Consider production implications

### When to Ask for Hints

**Strategic Hint Timing for L6/L7:**

- **After 3 minutes**: If you can't identify the pattern
- **After 8 minutes**: If you can't design the approach
- **After 20 minutes**: If implementation is significantly stuck
- **Never**: Ask for hints on basic syntax or simple edge cases

**How to Ask for Hints (maintains technical credibility):**
```
"I'm deciding between approach A and approach B. 
Approach A would use [PATTERN] with [COMPLEXITY],
while approach B would use [PATTERN] with [COMPLEXITY].
Could you confirm if I'm on the right track with approach A?"
```

### Architectural Implications Discussion

**Connecting Patterns to System Design:**

1. **Two Pointers** → Load balancing and resource optimization
2. **Sliding Window** → Real-time monitoring and rate limiting
3. **Fast & Slow Pointers** → Health checks and cycle detection
4. **Tree/Graph Traversal** → Dependency resolution and rollout planning
5. **Binary Search** → Configuration optimization and threshold tuning
6. **Dynamic Programming** → Cost optimization and strategic planning
7. **Backtracking** → Configuration space exploration
8. **Heap/Priority Queue** → Resource scheduling and priority management
9. **Intervals** → Capacity planning and resource allocation
10. **Topological Sort** → Build systems and deployment orchestration
