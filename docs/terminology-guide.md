# SystemCraft Terminology Guide with Practical Applications

This guide establishes standardized terminology across all documentation and provides concrete examples of proper usage in interview contexts. Consistent terminology improves clarity, professionalism, and interview success.

!!! info "Why Terminology Matters"
    **Real Interview Feedback (December 2024)**: "The candidate kept referring to themselves as a 'manager' without establishing scope. We couldn't assess whether their stories demonstrated L6-level impact."

## Role Levels with Interview Applications

### L6 Role: Senior Engineering Manager
- **First mention**: "Senior Engineering Manager (L6)"
- **Subsequent mentions**: "L6" is acceptable
- **Avoid**: SDM, SDM II, Senior SDM, Senior Manager, or other variations

#### Practical Usage in Interviews

**✅ Strong Opening in STAR Stories**:
```markdown
"As a Senior Engineering Manager (L6) responsible for the payments platform serving 50 million transactions monthly..."
```

**✅ Establishing Scope and Authority**:
```markdown
"In my L6 role, I managed 18 engineers across 3 teams and owned the $15M infrastructure budget..."
```

**❌ Weak or Confusing References**:
```markdown
"As a senior manager, I worked on systems..." (unclear level and scope)
"When I was an SDM II..." (Amazon-specific terminology that confuses)
```

**Real Success Example (November 2024 L6 Candidate)**:
"I opened every behavioral response by clearly establishing my L6-equivalent scope. When I said 'As a Senior Engineering Manager responsible for customer identity platform serving 200M users,' the interviewer immediately understood my level and could assess impact appropriately."

### L7 Role: Principal Engineering Manager
- **First mention**: "Principal Engineering Manager (L7)"
- **Subsequent mentions**: "L7" is acceptable
- **Avoid**: Senior SDM, Principal SDM, Principal Manager, or other variations

#### Practical Usage in Interviews

**✅ Demonstrating Organizational Impact**:
```markdown
"As a Principal Engineering Manager (L7), I transformed how our 500-engineer organization approached technical debt..."
```

**✅ Strategic Scope Communication**:
```markdown
"My L7 responsibilities included platform strategy affecting 15 business units and $100M in annual revenue..."
```

**Real L7 Success Pattern (September 2024)**:
"Every story I told established organizational-level scope appropriate for L7. I never talked about individual team problems—always transformation challenges affecting multiple organizations."

## Interview Process Terms with Context

### Bar Raiser
- **Standard format**: "Bar Raiser" (capital B, capital R)
- **Avoid**: bar raiser, Bar raiser, bar Raiser

#### Interview Context Usage

**✅ Professional Reference**:
```markdown
"I'm prepared for the Bar Raiser round, which I understand focuses on cultural fit and raising the bar."
```

**✅ In Preparation Discussions**:
```markdown
"My Bar Raiser interview will likely emphasize Leadership Principles across multiple scenarios."
```

**Real Candidate Preparation (October 2024)**:
"I specifically practiced for the Bar Raiser round by preparing stories that showed exceptional leadership and judgment. The consistent terminology helped me sound professional when discussing the process."

### Leadership Principles
- **In headers**: "Leadership Principles" (full term)
- **In body text**: "LPs" is acceptable for brevity
- **Avoid**: leadership principles, Leadership principles, LP (singular in plural context)

#### Interview Application Examples

**✅ Professional Integration**:
```markdown
"This story demonstrates three Leadership Principles: Customer Obsession, Ownership, and Deliver Results."
```

**✅ Casual Reference in Practice**:
```markdown
"I've mapped this experience to four LPs and can adapt the story depending on the specific question."
```

**✅ In Mock Interview Context**:
```markdown
"Which Leadership Principles do you think this story demonstrates most strongly?"
```

**Real Interview Success (January 2025)**:
"I naturally integrated Leadership Principles terminology without sounding robotic. When I said 'This demonstrates Customer Obsession because...', it felt conversational, not rehearsed."

### STAR Framework
- **Standard format**: "STAR" (no periods)
- **Avoid**: S.T.A.R., Star, star

#### Practical Interview Usage

**✅ Framework Reference**:
```markdown
"Let me structure this response using the STAR framework..."
```

**✅ In Preparation Discussions**:
```markdown
"I've prepared 15 STAR stories covering all Leadership Principles."
```

**✅ During Technical Interviews**:
```markdown
"I'll walk through my architectural decision using STAR format to show the business impact."
```

**Real Preparation Success (December 2024)**:
"Using consistent STAR terminology in my practice sessions made the framework feel natural. During interviews, I could reference the structure without sounding mechanical."

## Technical and System Design Terminology

### Scaling Terms with Interview Context

**✅ Professional System Design Language**:
```markdown
"The system handles millions of concurrent users with sub-100ms latency..."
"Our microservices architecture serves billions of requests daily..."
"The distributed cache reduces database load by 80%..."
```

**❌ Vague or Unprofessional Language**:
```markdown
"The system is really big and handles lots of users..."
"We use microservices and stuff..."
"The cache makes things faster..."
```

**Real L7 Interview Success (August 2024)**:
"I used precise technical terminology throughout my system design interview. When I said 'horizontally partitioned database with consistent hashing for even load distribution,' the interviewer immediately recognized my technical depth."

### Quantification Standards

**✅ Specific Metrics**:
- "Improved performance by 40%" (not "made it faster")
- "Reduced latency from 500ms to 50ms" (not "much better response time")
- "Managed 25 engineers across 4 teams" (not "large team")
- "$15M annual revenue impact" (not "significant business value")

**Real Interview Impact (November 2024)**:
"Every metric I shared was specific and verifiable. When I said 'reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes, enabling 3x more frequent releases,' the interviewer could assess the real impact."

## Amazon-Specific Cultural Terms

### Working Backwards
- **Standard usage**: "Working backwards from the customer"
- **In STAR stories**: "I applied Amazon's working backwards methodology..."
- **Avoid**: "backwards engineering" or "reverse engineering"

### Day 1 Mentality
- **Standard format**: "Day 1 mentality" or "Day 1 mindset"
- **Interview context**: "This demonstrates Amazon's Day 1 approach to innovation..."
- **Avoid**: "day one thinking" or "startup mentality"

### Bias for Action
- **As Leadership Principle**: "Bias for Action"
- **In story context**: "This exemplifies Bias for Action because I made the decision with 70% of the information rather than waiting..."
- **Avoid**: "bias toward action" or "action bias"

## Exception Cases and Special Situations

### Quoted Content Preservation
When content is directly quoted from interviews or official Amazon sources, preserve the original terminology to maintain authenticity.

**Example**: If a candidate quote uses "manager" instead of "L6", preserve it:
> "Real L6 Candidate: 'As a manager at Netflix, I faced a similar challenge...'"

### File Names and Navigation
Do not change file names or navigation structures as part of terminology standardization. Technical infrastructure should remain stable.

### Code Comments and Technical Examples
Preserve existing terminology in code blocks unless it directly impacts understanding or interview relevance.

```python
# Preserve technical accuracy over terminology consistency
class SystemDesignSolution:  # Keep as-is even if "Solution" isn't standardized
    def __init__(self):
        self.manager = EngineringManager()  # Technical context preserved
```

## Interview Communication Guidelines

### First Impressions Matter
**Opening Statements Template**:
```markdown
"As a [Senior/Principal] Engineering Manager with [X] years of experience managing [Y] engineers, I've led [specific domain] initiatives that [quantified business impact]."
```

**Real Success Example**:
"I opened with 'As a Senior Engineering Manager who built the fraud detection platform serving 100M transactions daily, reducing false positives by 60%.' The interviewer immediately understood my scope and expertise."

### Maintaining Professional Tone
**Throughout Interview**:
- Use consistent role terminology
- Reference Leadership Principles naturally
- Apply STAR framework without announcing it
- Include specific metrics and scope indicators

**Avoid Common Mistakes**:
- Switching between different role titles
- Using Amazon jargon incorrectly
- Over-explaining frameworks
- Vague or inflated metrics

## Implementation Guidelines for Candidates

### Pre-Interview Checklist
- [ ] Consistent role title usage in all materials (resume, LinkedIn, interview responses)
- [ ] STAR stories use professional terminology throughout
- [ ] Leadership Principles referenced naturally and correctly
- [ ] Technical terms used precisely and appropriately
- [ ] Metrics are specific, verifiable, and impactful

### During Interview Best Practices
1. **Establish Scope Early**: Use proper role terminology in opening statements
2. **Be Consistent**: Don't switch between different ways of referring to the same concept
3. **Sound Natural**: Professional terminology should flow conversationally
4. **Show Knowledge**: Correct usage demonstrates cultural and professional awareness

### Real Feedback Integration
**Positive Interviewer Feedback (December 2024)**:
"The candidate spoke our language—used appropriate role terminology, referenced Leadership Principles naturally, and communicated with the precision we expect from senior leaders."

**Learning from Mistakes (October 2024)**:
"I kept saying 'senior dev' instead of 'Senior Software Engineer' and 'management stuff' instead of specific Leadership Principles. It made me sound unprofessional and unprepared."
