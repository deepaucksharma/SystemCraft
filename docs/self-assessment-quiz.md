## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I target L6 or L7 based on my score?**
**A**: Generally, target L6 if you manage <15 engineers and have <12 years experience. Target L7 only if you score 80+ AND have experience managing 20+ engineers across multiple teams with organizational transformation experience.

**Q: How often should I retake this assessment?**
**A**: Every 4 weeks during major preparation phases, every 2 weeks during final preparation. The assessment helps track progress and adjust preparation focus.

**Q: What if I score high in some areas but low in others?**
