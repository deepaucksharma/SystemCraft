## üéØ Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Shared Components

‚úÖ **Use shared components when:**
- Content appears in 3+ different pages
- Information needs to stay synchronized across sections
- You want to ensure consistency of critical information
- Creating quick reference or summary sections
- Building study guides or checklists

‚úÖ **Good examples:**
- Adding STAR framework to multiple behavioral prep pages
- Including L6 vs L7 comparison in decision-making sections
- Providing LP reference in multiple preparation guides
- Standardizing compensation info across offer-related content

### When to Use Inline Content

‚ùå **Use inline content when:**
- Information is highly specific to one context
- Content needs significant customization for the specific page
- Including only a small subset of the component content
- The component would feel disconnected from surrounding content

‚ùå **Examples of inline use:**
- Page-specific examples and case studies
- Contextual explanations that reference specific page content
- Customized checklists that combine multiple component concepts
- Narrative content that flows with the specific page story

### Component Customization Points

Each component includes customization markers for:

#### Context-Specific Modifications
```markdown
<!-- Customization Point: Add page-specific examples here -->
<!-- Customization Point: Modify for specific audience (L6 vs L7) -->
<!-- Customization Point: Add local links to related sections -->
```

#### Content Adaptation
- **Audience Level:** Components can be filtered for L6 or L7 specific content
- **Depth:** Some components support brief vs comprehensive versions
- **Focus Area:** Technical vs behavioral vs strategic emphasis

### Integration Best Practices

#### 1. Contextual Introduction
Always introduce shared components with context:

```markdown
## STAR Framework Overview

The following provides the standard STAR structure used throughout Amazon interviews:

{% include "_includes/star-template.md" %}

For L6-specific STAR examples, see [L6 Behavioral Scenarios](../behavioral/l6-scenarios.md).
```

#### 2. Follow-up Links
Connect components to detailed content:

```markdown
{% include "_includes/l6-vs-l7-summary.md" %}

For complete analysis and detailed examples, see the [comprehensive L6 vs L7 comparison](../fundamentals/l6-vs-l7.md).
```

#### 3. Selective Inclusion
Use components strategically, not automatically:

```markdown
<!-- Include full LP list in comprehensive guides -->
{% include "_includes/lp-list.md" %}

<!-- Include only abbreviations in quick reference -->
{% include "_includes/lp-abbreviations.md" %}
```

## üîß Maintenance Guidelines

### Updating Components

**Component updates should:**
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing includes
- Preserve customization points and comments
- Update version information when content changes significantly
- Reflect the most current and authoritative information

**Update triggers:**
- New Amazon interview data or process changes
- Compensation benchmarks refresh (quarterly)
- Leadership Principle updates or emphasis changes
- User feedback indicating inaccuracies or gaps

### Quality Standards

All shared components must maintain:
- **Accuracy:** Information verified against multiple sources
- **Completeness:** Comprehensive coverage of the topic area
- **Clarity:** Clear, actionable guidance without jargon
- **Consistency:** Aligned with terminology guide and content standards
- **Relevance:** Focus on information that helps interview success

### Testing Component Changes

Before updating components:
1. Identify all pages that include the component
2. Review how changes affect each context
3. Test that customization points still work
4. Verify links and cross-references remain valid
5. Update version information and change notes
