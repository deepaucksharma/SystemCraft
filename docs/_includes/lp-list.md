## ðŸŒŸ Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles

### Core Leadership Principles

**1. Customer Obsession**  
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.

**2. Ownership**  
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.

**3. Invent and Simplify**  
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.

**4. Are Right, A Lot**  
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives.

**5. Learn and Be Curious**  
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves and their teams.

**6. Hire and Develop the Best**  
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They coach others and take seriously their role in developing people.

### Execution Excellence

**7. Insist on the Highest Standards**  
Leaders have relentlessly high standardsâ€”many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.

**8. Think Big**  
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.

**9. Bias for Action**  
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study.

**10. Frugality**  
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.

### Trust and Communication

**11. Earn Trust**  
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They vocally self-critique.

**12. Dive Deep**  
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics differ from anecdotes.

**13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**  
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable.

### Results and Responsibility

**14. Deliver Results**  
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

**15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer**  
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment.

**16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility**  
We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect.
