## Core Impact Categories

### 1. Revenue Generation Impact

#### Direct Revenue Creation
**Definition**: New revenue directly generated by engineering initiatives
**Calculation Methods**:
- New feature conversion: (New conversions) × (Average order value) × (Attribution %)
- Platform enablement: (New products enabled) × (Revenue per product) × (Platform attribution %)
- Market expansion: (New market revenue) × (Platform enablement %)

**L6 Example**: Mobile App Feature Revenue
```
Situation: Added one-click checkout to mobile app
Calculation:
- Pre-feature mobile conversion: 2.3%
- Post-feature mobile conversion: 3.1% 
- Mobile traffic: 150K monthly visitors
- Average order value: $65
- Additional conversions: 150K × (3.1% - 2.3%) = 1,200 monthly
- Monthly revenue impact: 1,200 × $65 = $78K
- Annual revenue impact: $78K × 12 = $936K
- Conservative estimate: $900K annually
```

**L7 Example**: Global Platform Revenue Enablement
```
Situation: Built platform enabling international expansion
Calculation:  
- New markets enabled: 8 countries
- Average market revenue potential: $12M annually
- Platform attribution: 75% (engineering enablement)
- Actual market penetration: 65% of potential
- Revenue impact: 8 × $12M × 75% × 65% = $46.8M annually
- Conservative estimate: $40M+ annually
```

#### Revenue Protection/Recovery
**Definition**: Preventing revenue loss or recovering lost revenue streams
**Calculation Methods**:
- Churn prevention: (Customers retained) × (Annual customer value)
- Performance recovery: (Traffic recovered) × (Conversion rate) × (Average order value)  
- Downtime prevention: (Downtime hours prevented) × (Revenue per hour)

**L6 Example**: Customer Retention Through Performance Fix
```
Situation: Fixed checkout latency preventing customer churn
Calculation:
- Customers at risk of churn: 2,400 enterprise accounts
- Average customer annual value: $180K
- Churn prevention attribution: 23% (performance was primary complaint)
- Retention improvement: 89% (from exit surveys)
- Revenue protected: 2,400 × $180K × 23% × 89% = $88.7M
- Conservative attribution to engineering fix: 15%
- Revenue impact: $88.7M × 15% = $13.3M
- L6 level claim: $2.3M (more conservative estimate)
```

**L7 Example**: Platform Reliability Revenue Protection

## Impact Attribution Methodology

### Direct Attribution (90-100% confidence)
**When to Use**: Engineering work directly and measurably creates the impact
**Examples**: 
- Performance improvements with clear before/after metrics
- New features with isolated A/B testing results
- Cost optimization with direct infrastructure measurement

### Strong Attribution (70-89% confidence)  
**When to Use**: Engineering work is primary driver but other factors contribute
**Examples**:
- Customer experience improvements involving engineering + UX
- Revenue growth from platform capabilities + business development
- Efficiency gains from automation + process improvements

### Conservative Attribution (50-69% confidence)
**When to Use**: Engineering work is significant contributor among several factors
**Examples**:
- Market expansion enabled by platform + business strategy + sales
- Customer retention through reliability + customer success + product improvements
- Revenue growth from technical capabilities + marketing + market conditions

### Attribution Documentation Framework
For each impact claim, document:
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Clear before-state metrics
2. **Intervention Details**: Specific engineering work performed
3. **Impact Measurement**: After-state metrics with timing
4. **Attribution Logic**: Reasoning for claimed attribution percentage  
5. **Supporting Evidence**: A/B tests, correlation analysis, business case studies

## Presentation Best Practices

### Quantification Credibility Factors

#### Strong Credibility Indicators
- **Specific Numbers**: "$2.34M" vs "over $2M"
- **Time-bound Impact**: "Annually" vs "eventually"  
- **Measurement Methods**: "A/B tested" vs "estimated"
- **Conservative Estimates**: "At least $X" vs "up to $X"
- **Attribution Logic**: Clear explanation of how impact is attributed

#### Weak Credibility Indicators
- **Round Numbers**: "$5M" vs "$4.7M" (suggests estimation vs measurement)
- **Vague Timeframes**: "Significant impact" vs "18% improvement over 6 months"
- **No Attribution**: Taking full credit for complex business outcomes
- **Unrealistic Scale**: L6 claiming $20M+ impact without strong justification

### Interview Presentation Framework

#### 2-Minute Impact Summary
1. **Context** (20 seconds): Business situation requiring intervention
2. **Engineering Action** (45 seconds): Specific technical work performed
3. **Measurement** (30 seconds): How impact was measured and attributed
4. **Results** (25 seconds): Quantified business impact with timeframe

#### Detailed Impact Defense (Follow-up Questions)
Be prepared to explain:
- **Measurement Methodology**: How numbers were calculated
- **Attribution Logic**: Why you claim X% credit for the impact
- **Timeline**: When impact was realized and measured
- **Sustainability**: Whether impact is ongoing or one-time
- **Supporting Evidence**: Additional data points supporting the claim

## Common Impact Quantification Mistakes

### L6 Level Mistakes
1. **Overreaching Scale**: Claiming $10M+ impact without clear methodology
2. **Weak Attribution**: Taking full credit for business unit success
3. **Vague Metrics**: Using percentages without absolute numbers
4. **Unrealistic Precision**: Claiming exact impact without measurement systems

### L7 Level Mistakes  
1. **Under-selling Impact**: Claiming only direct technical impact, missing business value
2. **Missing Strategic Value**: Focusing on immediate rather than long-term impact
3. **No Platform Thinking**: Claiming individual project impact rather than organizational capability
4. **Weak External Validation**: No industry recognition or peer adoption evidence

## Impact Portfolio Strategy

### L6 Portfolio Balance
- **3-4 Large Impact Stories**: $1M-$3M each with strong attribution
- **5-6 Medium Impact Stories**: $200K-$800K each with direct measurement  
- **2-3 Learning Stories**: Lower impact but high learning/growth demonstration
- **Total Portfolio Value**: $5M-$12M across all stories

### L7 Portfolio Balance
- **2-3 Strategic Impact Stories**: $10M-$30M each with platform/organizational scope
- **3-4 Business Transformation Stories**: $5M-$15M each with cross-functional leadership
- **2-3 Industry Influence Stories**: External impact through standards, open source, thought leadership
- **Total Portfolio Value**: $50M-$100M+ across all stories with multi-year strategic impact

## Validation and Defense Strategies

### Internal Validation
- **Finance Team Validation**: Get finance team to validate revenue impact calculations
- **Business Stakeholder Confirmation**: Have business partners confirm impact attribution
- **Historical Data**: Use company financial reports to support large impact claims
- **Peer Review**: Have other technical leaders review impact methodology

### External Validation
- **Industry Recognition**: Conference speaking, awards, publications supporting impact claims
- **Customer Testimonials**: Customer references confirming business impact
- **Vendor Partnerships**: Vendor case studies highlighting platform impact
- **Academic Collaboration**: Research publications validating technical innovation impact

### Interview Defense Preparation
Practice explaining:
1. **"Walk me through your impact calculation"**
2. **"How do you know you can attribute X% to your work?"**  
3. **"What would you estimate differently if you did it again?"**
4. **"How did you validate these numbers?"**
5. **"What was the time horizon for realizing this impact?"**

## Conclusion

Impact quantification is both an art and a science requiring conservative estimation, clear attribution methodology, and credible measurement systems. L6 candidates should focus on direct, measurable team impact in the $1-5M range, while L7 candidates should demonstrate strategic value creation in the $10M+ range with organizational and industry influence.

The key to credible impact claims is conservative estimation with clear attribution logic, supported by measurement methodology and external validation where possible. Remember: it's better to under-claim and over-deliver evidence than to make claims you cannot defend.
