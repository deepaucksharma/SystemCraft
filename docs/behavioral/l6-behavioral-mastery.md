## Red Flags to Avoid

### Impact Scale Red Flags
- **Under $500K Impact**: Too small for L6 expectations
- **Single Team Scope**: Insufficient organizational influence
- **Individual Contributor Work**: Showing IC work instead of management
- **Quarterly Only Focus**: Missing longer-term thinking

### Leadership Red Flags
- **No Difficult Decisions**: Avoiding tough leadership moments
- **Perfect Success Stories**: No learning from failure examples
- **Blame Others**: Not taking ownership for team outcomes
- **Micromanagement**: Too much detail on individual contributor tasks

### Communication Red Flags
- **Vague Metrics**: Using unclear or unquantified results
- **Technical Jargon**: Over-focusing on technical details vs business impact
- **Linear Storytelling**: Missing complexity and nuance of real situations
- **No Follow-up**: Not showing sustained impact or learning application

## Key Differentiators from L7

- **Scope**: Component/service vs platform/organization
- **Planning**: Quarterly/annual vs multi-year strategic
- **Influence**: 15-50 engineers vs 50+ engineers
- **Impact**: $1-5M vs $10M+ revenue impact
- **Complexity**: Cross-team vs cross-organizational
- **External**: Limited vs significant industry visibility
