## üí¨ Handling Difficult Follow-Up Questions

### The "What If" Questions

**Question**: "What if your approach hadn't worked?"

**Strong Response Framework**:
1. **Acknowledge**: "That's a great question. I actually had contingency plans..."
2. **Plan B**: "If the initial approach failed, I would have..."
3. **Risk Mitigation**: "To prevent failure, I had established..."
4. **Learning**: "This taught me to always..."

**Example**:
"Great question. I had prepared a Plan B where we would have reverted to the old system while fixing issues offline. I had also set clear go/no-go criteria at each milestone. If we hadn't met the Week 2 metrics, I would have pivoted to bringing in external consultants. This experience taught me to always have rollback plans and clear success metrics."

### The "Failure" Questions

**Question**: "Tell me about your biggest failure"

**Strong Response Framework**:
1. **Own It**: Take full responsibility
2. **Impact**: Quantify the failure's impact
3. **Root Cause**: Show deep understanding
4. **Learning**: Specific changes you made
5. **Application**: How you've used this learning

| **3** | Mixed | At bar but concerns | Good stories but communication issues |
