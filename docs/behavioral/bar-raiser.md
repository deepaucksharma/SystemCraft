**"How do you balance technical innovation with operational stability?"**

**Strong Response Framework:**
```markdown
My approach balances innovation with stability through structured experimentation:

**Innovation Framework:**
- **Innovation Budget**: Allocate 20% of engineering capacity for innovation
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential impact vs. operational risk
- **Staged Rollout**: New technologies proven in non-critical systems first
- **Rollback Plans**: Always have clear rollback strategy

**Example Application:**
SITUATION: Team wanted to adopt new microservices architecture
ACTION: 
- Started with new, low-risk feature as microservice
- Measured operational impact (monitoring, alerting, deployment)
- Gradually extracted existing components based on learning
- Maintained operational excellence throughout transition

RESULT: Successfully modernized architecture over 18 months with zero major incidents

**Key Principles:**
- Innovation should solve real problems, not just use new technology
- Operational stability enables sustainable innovation
- Team learning and capability building is part of innovation
- Business value drives technology choices
