## üéØ PIP Success Story Template

### L6 PIP Success Story Example
```markdown
**Situation (45 seconds):**
I inherited a senior engineer, Sarah, who was struggling after 8 months in role. Her code review feedback was consistently negative, she missed 3 sprint commitments, and 2 team members raised concerns about collaboration. The team was losing confidence, and my manager suggested we consider a role change. Performance reviews showed declining ratings from "Meets" to "Below Expectations."

**Task (30 seconds):**
As the Engineering Manager, I needed to either help Sarah succeed in role or transition her out fairly. I had 60 days to see measurable improvement in code quality, delivery commitment, and team collaboration. The team's morale and sprint velocity depended on resolving this quickly.

**Action (2.5 minutes):**
Week 1: I spent 3 days diagnosing the root cause. Through 1:1s, I discovered Sarah felt overwhelmed by our codebase complexity and was too embarrassed to ask for help. She'd been working nights trying to catch up, creating more bugs.

I created a formal PIP with specific, achievable goals:
- Code quality: Zero critical bugs in reviews by day 30
- Delivery: Meet 100% of sprint commitments by day 45  
- Collaboration: Proactively ask questions in stand-ups daily

Week 2-3: I provided intensive support - daily 30-minute pairing sessions, assigned a senior engineer mentor, and enrolled her in our advanced architecture training. I also restructured her tasks to smaller, achievable chunks.

Week 4-5: Transitioned to every-other-day check-ins as her confidence grew. She started asking questions in stand-ups and her code reviews improved significantly.

Week 6-8: Sarah was not only meeting goals but started helping junior engineers. Her sprint velocity increased 40% and team feedback became positive.

**Result (45 seconds):**
After 60 days: Sarah exceeded all PIP goals, became a code quality advocate, and increased team velocity by 15%. She was promoted to Senior Engineer II within 6 months and later became my technical lead. The team's confidence was restored, and I learned that most performance issues stem from support gaps, not capability gaps.

**Reflection (30 seconds):**
This taught me to invest deeply in understanding root causes before taking action. Most struggling employees want to succeed - they need the right support structure, not management pressure.
```

### L7 PIP Success Story Example
```markdown
**Situation (45 seconds):**
A principal engineer in my organization of 120+ people was struggling with stakeholder management and strategic thinking. Despite strong technical skills, he consistently delivered tactical solutions when strategic thinking was needed, and his abrasive communication style had created conflicts with 3 VP stakeholders. The CTO questioned whether he was at the right level.

**Task (30 seconds):**
As the Senior Engineering Manager, I needed to either develop his strategic leadership capabilities or transition him to a more suitable role. The stakes were high - he influenced 40+ engineers across 6 teams, and his technical expertise was crucial for our platform evolution.

**Action (2.5 minutes):**
Root cause analysis revealed he'd been promoted for technical excellence but never received executive presence training. He saw strategic work as "fluff" compared to "real engineering."

I designed a comprehensive development plan:
- Executive coaching with external consultant
- Rotation through product management for 3 months
- Presentation training with communications team
- Paired him with successful principal for mentoring

Week 1-2: Initial resistance - he felt it was "beneath him." I reframed it as expanding his impact potential and tied it to promotion criteria for Distinguished Engineer.

Week 3-4: Started seeing mindset shift after product management rotation. He began understanding business context and customer impact of technical decisions.

Week 5-8: His presentations improved dramatically. VPs started commenting on his improved strategic thinking and communication style. He began influencing cross-team architectural decisions effectively.

**Result (45 seconds):**
After 60 days: He became our go-to principal for VP-level technical strategy discussions. Led successful migration affecting all 6 teams, saving $2M annually. Promoted to Distinguished Engineer within a year. Now regularly presents to C-level executives and has become a model for other principals.

**Reflection (30 seconds):**
I learned that high-performers often need different types of development. Sometimes the issue isn't capability but perspective - helping them see the bigger picture of their role and impact.

## üí° Advanced PIP Techniques

### The "Investment" Mindset
Frame PIPs as investments in people, not administrative burdens:
```markdown
"I approached this as a $200K investment - Sarah's annual cost - and asked what would give us the best ROI: development or replacement? Development won because her technical knowledge was irreplaceable."
```

### The "System Thinking" Approach
Show how you addressed systemic issues, not just individual ones:
```markdown
"While working with John, I realized our onboarding process had gaps that set people up to struggle. I fixed both the individual and the system."
```

### The "Culture Builder" Perspective
Demonstrate how PIPs reinforce team culture:
```markdown
"The team watched how I handled this situation. My thorough, fair approach showed we invest in people and maintain high standards simultaneously."
```
