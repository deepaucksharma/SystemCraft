```markdown
- **[Guide Name](file.md)** - Description
```

#### Proper Redirect Format
```markdown
**‚Üí [New Location](../new-location.md)**
```

*For immediate [topic], start with [Existing Guide](link.md) while this 
comprehensive guide is being developed.*
```

### Quality Standards

3. **Appropriate context** - explain why user should follow link
4. **Future-ready structure** - plan for content completion

1. **Never create empty files** that will be linked to
2. **Create placeholder content immediately** when adding navigation
3. **Use consistent "Coming Soon" formatting** for incomplete content
4. **Always provide temporary alternatives** for missing content

### Link Validation Process
1. **Before adding new links**: Verify target file exists and has content
2. **Monthly link audits**: Automated checking recommended
3. **Content completion tracking**: Update placeholders as content is added
4. **Cross-reference validation**: Ensure bidirectional link accuracy

### Quality Assurance
