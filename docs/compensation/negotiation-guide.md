### Understanding Amazon's Vesting Schedule

Amazon uses a unique backloaded vesting schedule:

- **Year 2:** 15% of RSUs vest  
- **Year 3:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)
- **Year 4:** 40% of RSUs vest (20% every 6 months)

**Sign-on bonuses** are designed to compensate for the low RSU vesting in years 1 and 2.

## üéØ Negotiation Strategy Framework

### Pre-Negotiation: Know Your Worth

#### 1. Gather Market Intelligence
```markdown
Research Checklist:
‚òê Check levels.fyi for recent Amazon offers at your level
‚òê Review Blind app for negotiation experiences
‚òê Connect with current Amazon EMs on LinkedIn
‚òê Get competing offers if possible
‚òê Understand team-specific budget constraints
```

#### 2. Calculate Your Walk-Away Number
<div class="calculator-section">

**Minimum Acceptable Package Calculator:**
- Current Total Comp: $________
- Cost of Living Adjustment: +$________
- Risk Premium (for job change): +$________
- Growth Opportunity Value: +$________
- **Walk-Away Number: $________**

</div>

#### 3. Document Your Leverage
- **Competing Offers:** Other FAANG or equivalent offers
- **Unique Skills:** Specialized experience Amazon needs
- **Market Timing:** Q4 budgets often have more flexibility
- **Team Need:** Urgent hiring needs increase negotiation power

---

## üí¨ The Negotiation Conversation

### Phase 1: Initial Offer Response

#### The Golden Rule
**Never accept the first offer immediately**, even if it exceeds expectations.

#### Script Template:
> "Thank you for the offer. I'm very excited about the opportunity to join [Team Name] and contribute to [specific project/goal]. I'd like to take 2-3 days to review the complete package and discuss with my family. Could we schedule a follow-up call for [specific date]?"

### Phase 2: The Counter-Offer

#### Negotiation Priority Framework

<div class="priority-matrix">

**L6 Priorities (in order):**
1. **RSU Package** - Highest long-term impact
2. **Sign-on Bonus** - Immediate cash flow
3. **Base Salary** - Least flexible but worth trying
4. **Start Date** - Can negotiate for sign-on bonus proration

**L7 Priorities (in order):**
1. **RSU Package** - Can vary by $400K+
2. **Base Salary** - More negotiable at L7
3. **Sign-on Structure** - Year 2 bonus often overlooked
4. **Title/Level** - Consider L7+ or Principal designation

</div>

#### Effective Counter-Offer Scripts

**For RSU Negotiation:**
> "Based on my research and conversations with peers at similar levels, I understand the RSU range for L6 in Seattle can go up to $400K. Given my [specific experience/skill], I believe a package closer to $380K would better reflect the value I bring."

**For Sign-on Bonus:**
> "I'll be walking away from $[X] in unvested equity at my current company. Would it be possible to structure the sign-on bonus to help offset this loss? I'm thinking $[Y] in year 1 and $[Z] in year 2."

**For Base Salary:**
> "I notice the base salary is at the lower end of the band. Given my [specific qualification], would it be possible to start at $[X], which I understand is still within the approved range for this level?"

### Phase 3: Advanced Negotiation Tactics

#### The "Multiple Dimensions" Approach
Don't negotiate just one component. Present a package:

> "I've thought about this holistically. Would the team be able to do:
> - Base: $185K (up from $175K)
> - RSU: $350K (up from $300K)  
> - Sign-on: $100K/$80K (up from $80K/$60K)
> 
> This would bring the total package in line with my other opportunities while still being within the L6 band."

#### The "Future Performance" Angle
> "I'm confident I can deliver exceptional results. Would you be open to a performance-based additional RSU grant review after year 1? This would align my compensation with the value I deliver."

#### The "Competing Offer" Play
> "I have an offer from [Company] at [rough total comp]. While I'm more excited about Amazon, the gap is significant. Can we work together to close it?"

---

## üìà Special Situations & Edge Cases

### Internal Transfers

**Key Differences:**
- Less negotiation flexibility (typically 5-10% range)
- Focus on level negotiation rather than comp
- Can negotiate "out-of-cycle" equity refreshers

**Strategy:**
> "As an internal candidate, I understand the constraints. However, given that external L6 hires are getting $X, and I already know our systems and culture, wouldn't it make sense to match that?"

### Boomerang Employees

**Advantages:**
- Can often negotiate higher due to "proven track record"
- Sign-on bonuses more flexible
- Possible to negotiate accelerated vesting

**Approach:**
> "Since I'm returning with additional experience from [Company], plus institutional knowledge of Amazon, I believe a premium above the standard L6 package is justified."

### Remote Positions

**Considerations:**
- Typically 10-15% lower than Seattle baseline
- Less negotiable on base salary
- Can sometimes negotiate "Seattle RSUs" if willing to relocate later

Day 7: Professional follow-up if no communication
```

```markdown
Day 10: Check-in on timeline if no updates
Day 14: Request status update if appropriate
```

**Week 3+ (Extended Timeline):**
```markdown

```

### Advanced Reference Strategy

#### Selecting Strategic References

**The Ideal Reference Panel:**
1. **Former Direct Manager**: Can speak to your performance and growth
2. **Cross-Functional Partner**: Product manager, designer, or business stakeholder
3. **Former Direct Report**: Can discuss your leadership and management style
4. **Senior Engineering Peer**: Can validate technical depth and collaboration

**Reference Preparation Framework:**
```markdown
**Information to Share with References:**

**Key Points for References to Address:**
- Specific examples of leadership impact

```

### Managing Multiple Opportunities

#### Coordination Strategy When You Have Multiple Offers

**Timeline Synchronization:**
```markdown
**Best Case Scenario:**
- All opportunities progress at similar pace
- Decision deadlines align within 1-2 weeks
- Ability to compare offers side-by-side

**Challenging Scenarios:**
- Amazon timeline slower than competing offers
- Exploding offers with short deadlines
- Opportunities in different stages of process

**Communication Approaches:**
With Amazon: "I have another opportunity with a decision deadline of [date]. While Amazon is my preferred choice, I need to respect the timeline. Is there any flexibility in your process?"

With Other Companies: "I'm very interested in this opportunity, but I'm also in final stages with another company. Could we discuss a brief extension to ensure I can make the best decision?"
```

#### Negotiation Leverage with Multiple Offers

**Using Competing Offers Effectively:**
```markdown
**Do:**
- Mention competing offers factually
- Focus on total compensation and role fit
- Be transparent about your preferences
- Use leverage to improve terms, not create ultimatums

**Don't:**
- Create false urgency or artificial deadlines
- Share specific company names unless necessary
- Use offers as threats rather than data points
- Burn bridges with unprofessional ultimatums

**Script Example:**
"I'm fortunate to have another offer that expires on [date]. While I'm more excited about the Amazon opportunity because of [specific reasons], there is a significant compensation gap. Is there flexibility in the package to help make the decision easier?"
```

### Handling Delays and Setbacks

#### When Things Take Longer Than Expected

**Common Delay Causes:**
- Interviewer availability for debrief sessions
- Hiring committee scheduling conflicts
- Budget approval processes at year-end/quarter-end
- Reference availability or international verification
- Background check complications

**Your Response Strategy:**
```markdown
**Week 3+ With No Update:**
Professional escalation: "I want to reiterate my strong interest in this opportunity. Could you provide an updated timeline for the decision process?"

**Week 4+ Extended Delay:**
Direct conversation: "I'm concerned about the timeline and would appreciate a frank conversation about where things stand. Are there any concerns about my candidacy that I should address?"

**Month+ Delays:**
Consider alternatives while maintaining professionalism
Request direct conversation with hiring manager
Evaluate whether delay indicates internal issues
```

#### Red Flags in the Post-Interview Process

**Process Red Flags:**
- Multiple weeks without any communication
- Requests for additional interviews without clear rationale
- Vague or contradictory information about timeline
- Changes in recruiter or hiring manager during process
- Reluctance to provide clear next steps

**Offer Red Flags:**
- Pressure to accept immediately without review time
