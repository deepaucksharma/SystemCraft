## 🏗️ Core Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create Base Structure
**Objective**: Establish the foundational components

```python
# src/main.py - Starting point
class [MainClass]:
    """[Brief description of what this class does]."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        """Initialize with configuration parameters."""
        self.config = config
        self.[attribute] = None
        
    def setup(self) -> bool:
        """Set up initial state and connections."""
        try:
            # Implementation steps
            self.[setup_step_1]()
            self.[setup_step_2]()
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Setup failed: {e}")
            return False
```

**Key Concepts**:
- [Concept 1]: [Why this approach]
- [Concept 2]: [Design decision rationale]
- [Concept 3]: [Trade-off explanation]

#### Step 2: Implement Core Logic
**Objective**: Build the primary functionality

```python
def [primary_method](self, input_data: [DataType]) -> [ReturnType]:
    """[Method description and purpose]."""
    
    # Input validation
    if not self.[validate_input](input_data):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input parameters")
    
    # Core processing logic
    processed_data = self.[process_data](input_data)
    result = self.[transform_result](processed_data)
    
    # Error handling and logging
    self.[log_operation](result)
    return result

def [supporting_method](self, data: [DataType]) -> [ReturnType]:
    """[Supporting method description]."""
    # Implementation details
    pass
```

**Interview Connection**: This pattern demonstrates [relevant interview concept] that's crucial for L6/L7 discussions about [specific topic].

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (15 minutes)

#### Step 3: Add Scalability Considerations
**Objective**: Implement production-ready features

```python
import asyncio
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

class [ScalableVersion]:
    """Enhanced version with scalability features."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        self.config = config
        self.connection_pool = self.[create_pool]()
        self.cache = self.[initialize_cache]()
        
    async def [async_method](self, batch_data: List[dict]) -> List[dict]:
        """Handle batch processing for scalability."""
        
        # Batch processing for efficiency
        tasks = []
        for chunk in self.[chunk_data](batch_data):
            task = asyncio.create_task(self.[process_chunk](chunk))
            tasks.append(task)
        
        # Wait for all tasks to complete
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        
        # Handle partial failures
        successful_results = []
        for result in results:
            if not isinstance(result, Exception):
                successful_results.extend(result)
            else:
                logging.error(f"Batch processing error: {result}")
        
        return successful_results
```

**Production Considerations**:
- **Concurrency**: [How this handles multiple requests]
- **Error Handling**: [Graceful failure management]
- **Monitoring**: [Observability and debugging]

#### Step 4: Implement Caching Strategy
**Objective**: Add performance optimization

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import redis

class [CachedVersion]:
    """Version with intelligent caching."""
    
    def __init__(self, redis_client: redis.Redis):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.local_cache = {}
    
    @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
    def [cached_computation](self, key: str) -> [ReturnType]:
        """Computationally expensive operation with caching."""
        
        # Check distributed cache first
        cached_result = self.redis.get(f"compute:{key}")
        if cached_result:
            return json.loads(cached_result)
        
        # Perform computation
        result = self.[expensive_computation](key)
        
        # Store in both caches
        self.redis.setex(f"compute:{key}", 3600, json.dumps(result))
        return result
```

**Caching Strategy**: [Explanation of multi-level caching approach]

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (15 minutes)

#### Step 5: Add Comprehensive Testing
**Objective**: Ensure reliability and maintainability

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
import pytest

class Test[MainClass](unittest.TestCase):
    """Comprehensive test suite."""
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.config = {
            'test_mode': True,
            'mock_external_services': True
        }
        self.instance = [MainClass](self.config)
    
    def test_[primary_functionality](self):
        """Test core functionality with valid input."""
        # Arrange
        test_input = [sample_data]
        expected_output = [expected_result]
        
        # Act
        result = self.instance.[primary_method](test_input)
        
        # Assert
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)
        self.assertTrue(self.instance.[validation_method](result))
    
    def test_[error_handling](self):
        """Test error handling with invalid input."""
        with self.assertRaises([ExpectedException]):
            self.instance.[primary_method]([invalid_data])
    
    @patch('[external_service_module]')
    def test_[external_integration](self, mock_service):
        """Test integration with external services."""
        # Configure mock
        mock_service.return_value = [mock_response]
        
        # Test integration
        result = self.instance.[integration_method]()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
        mock_service.assert_called_once()
```

**Testing Strategy**: [Explanation of testing approach and coverage]

#### Step 6: Add Monitoring and Observability
**Objective**: Production-ready observability

```python
import logging
import time
from functools import wraps
from typing import Dict, Any

def monitor_performance(func):
    """Decorator to monitor method performance."""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            duration = time.time() - start_time
            logging.info(f"{func.__name__} completed in {duration:.3f}s")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            duration = time.time() - start_time
            logging.error(f"{func.__name__} failed after {duration:.3f}s: {e}")
            raise
    return wrapper

class [MonitoredVersion]:
    """Version with comprehensive monitoring."""
    
    @monitor_performance
    def [monitored_method](self, data: dict) -> dict:
        """Method with performance monitoring."""
        
        # Log input characteristics
        logging.info(f"Processing {len(data)} items")
        
        # Your implementation here
        result = self.[process_data](data)
        
        # Log output characteristics
        logging.info(f"Generated {len(result)} results")
        return result
```

    # Execute
    instance = [MainClass]([test_config])
    result = instance.[primary_method](input_data)
    
    # Validation
    assert [validation_condition]
    assert len(result) > 0
    assert all([quality_check] for item in result)
```

#### Test Case 2: Edge Cases
```python

    """Test behavior with edge cases and boundary conditions."""
    
    edge_cases = [
        [],  # Empty input
        [single_item],  # Single item
        [large_dataset],  # Large input
        [malformed_data]  # Invalid data
    ]
    
    for test_case in edge_cases:
        try:
            result = instance.[primary_method](test_case)
            # Validate result is reasonable
            assert [reasonable_result_check]
        except [ExpectedException]:
            # Expected failure for invalid data
            pass
```

### Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
```python
import time
import concurrent.futures

def performance_test():
    """Test performance under load."""
    
    # Test parameters
    num_requests = 100
    concurrent_requests = 10
    
    def single_request():
        start = time.time()
        result = instance.[primary_method]([test_data])
        return time.time() - start
    
    # Execute concurrent requests
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=concurrent_requests) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(single_request) for _ in range(num_requests)]
        response_times = [future.result() for future in futures]
    
    # Analyze results
    avg_response_time = sum(response_times) / len(response_times)
    print(f"Average response time: {avg_response_time:.3f}s")
    print(f"95th percentile: {sorted(response_times)[int(len(response_times) * 0.95)]:.3f}s")
