## üé≠ Follow-up Questions and Manager Responses

### Technical Deep Dive Questions
**Q1: "How would you optimize this for very large datasets that don't fit in memory?"**

**Manager Response:**
"I'd consider several approaches: First, implement streaming processing to handle data in chunks. Second, use external sorting techniques if ordering is required. Third, leverage distributed computing frameworks like Spark for horizontal scaling. The choice depends on our infrastructure and latency requirements. I'd also work with the infrastructure team to understand our cluster capabilities and cost implications."

**Q2: "What if this needed to handle 1000x more requests per second?"**

**Manager Response:**
"At that scale, we'd need to architect for high throughput. I'd consider: caching frequently computed results, using async processing where possible, implementing circuit breakers for fault tolerance, and potentially pre-computing results for common inputs. We'd also need comprehensive monitoring and alerting to detect performance degradation early."

**Q3: "How would you ensure this code is maintainable by your team?"**

**Manager Response:**
"Code maintainability is crucial for team productivity. I'd ensure: comprehensive unit tests with high coverage, clear documentation and inline comments, consistent coding standards enforced through CI/CD, regular code reviews focusing on readability, and knowledge sharing sessions to ensure team understanding. I'd also implement proper logging and monitoring so issues can be debugged quickly."

### Leadership Principle Applications
**Customer Obsession:** "How does optimizing this algorithm benefit our customers?"
**Ownership:** "How would you ensure this code remains performant over time?"
**Invent and Simplify:** "Can you think of a simpler approach that meets our requirements?"

## üö® Common Manager Interview Mistakes

### Technical Mistakes
- **Over-optimization:** Don't optimize prematurely without understanding requirements
- **Under-explanation:** Always explain your thought process and trade-offs
- **Ignoring edge cases:** Consider and handle boundary conditions
- **Poor variable names:** Use descriptive names that make code self-documenting

### Manager-Specific Mistakes
- **Not considering team impact:** Think about code your team would maintain
- **Ignoring production concerns:** Consider monitoring, error handling, testing
- **Missing business context:** Connect technical solutions to business value
- **Over-engineering:** Choose solutions appropriate for the problem scale
