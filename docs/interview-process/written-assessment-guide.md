# Amazon Written Assessment Guide: Complete Preparation

## Overview: The Critical Missing Component

Amazon's written assessment occurs between the phone screen and onsite interviews for L6/L7 Engineering Manager positions. Despite being a make-or-break component, **fewer than 20% of candidates receive adequate preparation** for this critical evaluation.

!!! warning "Critical Gap Alert"
    **Industry Reality:** 40% of candidates who excel in technical/behavioral rounds fail due to poor written assessment performance. This guide addresses that gap with comprehensive, practical preparation.

!!! quote "2025 Candidate Insights"
    **L7 Success (February 2025):** "The written assessment was harder than the onsite. 90 minutes to write a 4-page organizational transformation plan with financial projections. Without structured preparation, I would have failed completely."
    
    **L6 Success (January 2025):** "My written assessment was about AI bias incident response. They wanted technical solution, stakeholder communication, AND long-term prevention - all with specific metrics and timelines."

### Model Answer Example: AI Bias Mitigation (L6)

**Executive Summary**

As Engineering Manager for our customer service AI platform, I will lead a comprehensive bias mitigation initiative addressing the demographic response quality disparities discovered in our production system. My immediate priority is customer impact mitigation within 48 hours, followed by systematic root cause elimination over 3 months. This initiative requires $500K investment and 40% of my team's capacity but will prevent potential $10M+ in customer churn and regulatory exposure while establishing Amazon-leading AI ethics practices.

**Situation Analysis**

**Current Impact Assessment:**
I conducted emergency analysis of our production data over the past 30 days, examining 1.5M customer interactions. The data reveals concerning patterns:
- Response quality scores vary 25% based on perceived customer demographics

## 7. Common Mistakes Guide

### Critical Content Mistakes

**Over-Engineering Solutions**
*Common Pattern:* Candidates design complex technical solutions that demonstrate deep expertise but ignore practical constraints, timeline pressures, and resource limitations.

*Example:* Proposing complete platform rewrite with cutting-edge technologies when incremental improvement would better serve customers.

*Fix:* Start with customer impact, then design minimum viable solution that delivers value while building toward longer-term vision.

*Red Flag Phrases:*
- "We should rebuild everything from scratch"
- "First, we'll implement a comprehensive microservices architecture"
- "The ideal solution would require 18 months and unlimited resources"

*Better Approach:*
- "Phase 1 focuses on immediate customer pain relief with minimal disruption"
- "I'll prioritize solutions that deliver value within 30 days"
- "My approach balances technical excellence with practical delivery"

**Lack of Business Context**
*Common Pattern:* Solutions focus purely on technical elegance without connecting to business value, customer impact, or competitive dynamics.

*Example:* Detailed architectural redesign without explaining how it improves customer experience or enables business growth.

*Fix:* Every technical decision must connect to customer value and business outcomes with quantified impact.

*Red Flag Phrases:*
- "This approach is more technically sound"
- "The architecture will be cleaner and more maintainable"
- "We should adopt industry best practices"

*Better Approach:*
- "This technical change will reduce customer wait time by 40%"
- "The architecture improvements enable 10x scale for projected growth"
- "Industry practices adapted for our specific customer needs"

**Missing Leadership Principles Integration**
*Common Pattern:* Solutions read like technical specifications rather than leadership documents demonstrating Amazon's values and culture.

*Example:* Detailed implementation plan without showing how the approach embodies Customer Obsession, Ownership, or Think Big.

*Fix:* Explicitly connect solution elements to Leadership Principles with specific examples of how you'll demonstrate them.

*Red Flag Phrases:*
- Pure technical language without leadership context
- Generic project management approaches
- Focus on what "the team" will do vs. what "I" will do

*Better Approach:*
- "My Customer Obsession drives prioritizing user experience over internal convenience"
- "I'll demonstrate Ownership by personally leading the highest-risk workstream"
- "This Think Big approach positions us ahead of market trends"

### Structural and Flow Problems

**Poor Structure and Organization**
*Common Pattern:* Stream-of-consciousness writing that jumps between topics without clear logical progression.

*Fix:* Use clear section headers, logical flow from problem to solution to implementation, and smooth transitions between ideas.

**Insufficient Quantification**
*Common Pattern:* Vague claims about impact without specific metrics, timelines, or success criteria.

*Example:* "This will significantly improve customer satisfaction" vs. "This will improve customer satisfaction from 3.7 to 4.2+ within 6 months"

*Fix:* Every claim should include specific metrics, timelines, and measurement approaches.

**Weak Personal Accountability**
*Common Pattern:* Describing what "the team" or "we" will do without clearly articulating personal leadership and ownership.

*Fix:* Use first-person statements showing specific personal responsibility and accountability.

### Writing and Communication Issues

**Passive Voice and Weak Language**
*Red Flag Examples:*
- "Improvements would be made to the system"
- "It is believed that customer satisfaction could be enhanced"
- "The approach might result in better outcomes"

*Strong Alternatives:*
- "I will improve system performance by implementing X"
- "My analysis shows customer satisfaction will improve 15% through Y"
- "This approach delivers Z measurable outcomes"

**Academic vs. Business Writing Style**
*Academic Style Problems:*
- Excessive background and literature review
- Theoretical frameworks without practical application
- Hedging language that avoids commitments
- Focus on methodology over results

*Business Writing Solutions:*
- Executive summary with clear recommendations
- Practical solutions with implementation focus
- Confident language with specific commitments
- Results-oriented with success metrics

**Typos and Grammar Errors**
*Critical Impact:* Even small errors can signal lack of attention to detail, which is especially damaging for senior leadership roles.

*Prevention:*
- Read document aloud during review
- Use spell-check and grammar tools
- Save 5 minutes for final proofread
- Focus on common error patterns (their/there, its/it's, effect/affect)

### Leadership and Strategy Pitfalls

**Not Addressing Difficult Decisions**
*Common Pattern:* Solutions that avoid hard choices, controversial trade-offs, or potential conflicts.

*Example:* "We'll implement both options to satisfy all stakeholders" instead of making clear decisions with rationale.

*Fix:* Demonstrate decision-making capability by taking clear positions with supporting rationale.
