## Core Assessment Structure

### Section 1: Leadership Principle Scenarios (60% of assessment)

#### Customer Obsession Scenarios
**Example Scenario:**
A customer reports a critical bug affecting their business operations. You have three competing priorities: a demo for potential enterprise client tomorrow, your team's sprint planning session, and quarterly performance reviews due today. What is your most likely response?

A) Prioritize the customer bug fix and reschedule other commitments
B) Delegate the bug to a team member while continuing with planned activities  
C) Ask the customer for a workaround while you complete existing commitments
D) Schedule the bug fix for next sprint to avoid disrupting current priorities

**L6 Winning Choice**: A (demonstrates customer obsession with ownership)
**L7 Winning Choice**: A with additional consideration of systemic improvements

B) Take initiative to coordinate cross-team solution despite the complexity
C) Focus on your team's portion and let other teams address their parts
D) Escalate to senior leadership for direction and resource allocation

**L6 Winning Choice**: B (shows ownership beyond direct responsibilities)
**L7 Winning Choice**: B with additional focus on organizational learning and scaling

#### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
**Example Scenario:**
Your manager proposes a strategy you believe will harm long-term product quality but meets short-term revenue goals. In the meeting, you would most likely:

A) Voice concerns privately after the meeting to avoid public disagreement
B) Present alternative approaches with data to support long-term thinking
C) Support the decision publicly while documenting your concerns

4. Third-party solution requiring significant integration

Rate the importance of these factors in your decision:
