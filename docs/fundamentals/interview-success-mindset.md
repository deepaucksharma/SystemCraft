# Interview Success Mindset for Amazon L6/L7 Candidates

## The Mental Game: Your Hidden Advantage

Success in Amazon L6/L7 interviews isn't just about technical knowledge and STAR stories—it's about approaching the interview with the right mindset. This guide helps you develop the mental framework that separates successful candidates from those who know the material but fail to convey their leadership potential.

## Core Mindset Principles

### 1. You're Interviewing Them Too

**Shift Your Perspective**:
- You're not begging for a job; you're evaluating a mutual fit
- You're assessing if Amazon's culture aligns with your values
- You're determining if the role will accelerate your career growth
- You're evaluating your future manager and team

**What This Looks Like**:
```
Instead of: "I hope I answer their questions correctly"
Think: "Let me share my experiences and see if we're aligned on leadership philosophy"

Instead of: "What if they ask something I don't know?"
Think: "I'll demonstrate my problem-solving approach and learning agility"

Instead of: "I need to impress them"
Think: "I need to authentically represent my capabilities and see if there's a match"
```

### 2. Embrace the Bar Raiser Dynamic

**Understanding the Bar Raiser's Role**:
- They're not there to fail you; they're ensuring quality hiring
- They want you to succeed if you're the right fit
- They're looking for reasons to say YES, not NO
- Their tough questions help you demonstrate your best qualities

**Reframe Challenging Questions**:
- Tough questions = Opportunity to show depth
- Follow-ups = Chance to demonstrate thoroughness
- Pushback = Platform to show conviction and flexibility
- "Tell me more" = They're engaged and want to hire you

### 3. Own Your Narrative

**You Control the Story**:
- Every question is an opportunity to reinforce your leadership brand
- You decide which experiences to highlight
- You shape how your journey is perceived
- You determine the energy and confidence level

**Leadership Brand Components**:
- Technical Excellence + Business Acumen
- People Leadership + Strategic Thinking  
- Customer Focus + Innovation Drive
- Execution Power + Long-term Vision
