!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    The biggest mistake candidates make is not understanding the level expectations. L6 candidates who try to demonstrate L7 scope often fail because they can't back it up with depth. L7 candidates who focus on L6-level problems appear to lack strategic thinking. Know your level and prepare accordingly.
