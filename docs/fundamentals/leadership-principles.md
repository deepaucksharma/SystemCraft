!!! success "The Ultimate LP Secret (2025 Update)"
    **From a 2025 Bar Raiser**: "We're not looking for perfect people. We're looking for people who embody these principles naturally, learn from mistakes, and will raise the bar for the team they join. In 2025, we particularly value leaders who can balance innovation with responsibility - those who think about long-term impact on customers, communities, and the planet. Authenticity beats perfection, but awareness of broader impact is essential."
