# Distributed Systems Deep Dive for L6/L7 Engineering Leaders

!!! info "Essential Reading for Engineering Managers"
    This comprehensive guide covers distributed systems concepts, patterns, and trade-offs critical for Amazon L6/L7 engineering leadership interviews. Focus on understanding principles, communicating trade-offs, and making architectural decisions at scale.

## Executive Summary

As an L6/L7 engineering manager, you'll be expected to architect systems that serve millions of users, make informed trade-off decisions, and guide teams through complex distributed systems challenges. This guide provides the depth needed for technical leadership interviews while connecting concepts to real-world scenarios you'll encounter at Amazon scale.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand fundamental distributed systems principles and their business implications
- Communicate architectural trade-offs effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Make informed decisions about consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
- Design systems for Amazon-scale challenges (millions of users, global distribution)
- Lead technical teams through complex distributed systems implementation

## Part I: Foundational Concepts

### 1. What Makes Systems "Distributed"

A distributed system is one where components located on different networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages. At Amazon scale, distribution isn't optional—it's required by:

**Business Requirements:**
- Global user base requiring low latency worldwide
- Massive scale requiring horizontal scaling beyond single machines
- High availability requirements (99.99%+ uptime)
- Compliance requirements (data residency, regulatory isolation)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Fault tolerance across data centers, availability zones, and regions
- Independent deployability and team autonomy
- Cost optimization through resource sharing and elasticity

#### Real-World Example: Amazon Prime Video
Prime Video demonstrates distributed systems principles at scale:
- **Content Distribution**: CDN with global edge locations
- **User Management**: Distributed across regions with eventual consistency
- **Recommendation Engine**: Microservices architecture with data locality
- **Payment Processing**: Strong consistency with sophisticated compensation patterns

### 2. The Fundamental Challenge: CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem states that in a distributed system, you can guarantee at most two of:
- **Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- **Availability (A)**: System remains operational and responsive
- **Partition Tolerance (P)**: System continues despite network failures

#### Understanding CAP in Practice

**Why P is Non-Optional at Scale:**
Network partitions are not rare events at Amazon scale—they're daily occurrences. With thousands of services across multiple regions, network failures happen constantly. Therefore, you must choose between C and A.

**CA Systems (Partition Intolerant):**
- Single-database systems (traditional RDBMS)
- Cannot handle network partitions gracefully
- Appropriate for: Specific transactional requirements within single AZ

**CP Systems (Consistency over Availability):**
- Banking systems, inventory management
- Will refuse service rather than serve stale data
- **Example**: DynamoDB with strongly consistent reads
- **Trade-off**: May become unavailable during partitions

**AP Systems (Availability over Consistency):**
- Social media feeds, shopping recommendations
- Will serve potentially stale data to maintain availability
- **Example**: DynamoDB with eventually consistent reads
- **Trade-off**: Temporary inconsistencies possible

#### Interview Scenario: E-commerce Cart Design

**Question**: "Design a shopping cart service for Amazon. How would you handle CAP trade-offs?"

**L6/L7 Response Framework:**
1. **Business Context**: "For shopping carts, availability is crucial—customers abandoning carts due to service unavailability costs more than temporary inconsistencies."

2. **Technical Decision**: "I'd design for AP (availability + partition tolerance) with eventual consistency, because:
   - Lost availability = immediate revenue loss
   - Cart inconsistencies are recoverable through merge strategies
   - Users expect cart persistence across sessions/devices"

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Use eventually consistent storage (DynamoDB)
   - Implement conflict resolution for concurrent updates
   - Design graceful degradation patterns

4. **Monitoring and Recovery**:
   - Track consistency lag metrics
   - Implement alerting for extended inconsistency periods
   - Design customer-visible recovery mechanisms

### 3. Consistency Models Spectrum

Beyond CAP's binary choice, real systems implement various consistency models:

#### Strong Consistency
- All reads see the most recent write immediately
- **Implementation**: Synchronous replication, consensus protocols
- **Use Cases**: Financial transactions, inventory counts
- **AWS Examples**: DynamoDB strongly consistent reads, RDS Multi-AZ

#### Eventual Consistency
- System will become consistent over time if no new updates occur
- **Implementation**: Asynchronous replication, conflict resolution
- **Use Cases**: User profiles, product catalogs, social feeds
- **AWS Examples**: S3, DynamoDB default reads, Route 53

#### Causal Consistency
- Causally related operations are seen in same order by all nodes
- **Implementation**: Vector clocks, happens-before relationships
- **Use Cases**: Collaborative editing, message threads
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding operation dependencies

#### Session Consistency
- Individual client sees consistent view of data
- **Implementation**: Session affinity, read-your-writes guarantees
- **Use Cases**: User settings, personalization data
- **AWS Examples**: ElastiCache with session affinity

### 4. Consensus and Coordination

Distributed systems need agreement mechanisms for critical decisions.

#### Consensus Algorithms

**Raft Algorithm:**
- Leader election and log replication
- Easier to understand than Paxos
- **Use Cases**: Configuration management, distributed databases
- **Interview Focus**: Explain leader election, log replication process

**Paxos Algorithm:**
- More general consensus protocol
- Handles network partitions and failures
- **Use Cases**: Distributed databases, coordination services
- **Interview Focus**: Understand problems it solves, not implementation details

#### Coordination Patterns

**Distributed Locks:**
```python
# Example: Distributed lock for critical sections
class DistributedLock:
    def __init__(self, dynamodb_table, lock_name, ttl=30):
        self.table = dynamodb_table
        self.lock_name = lock_name
        self.ttl = ttl
    
    def acquire(self):
        try:
            # Atomic conditional put
            self.table.put_item(
                Item={
                    'lock_name': self.lock_name,
                    'expires_at': time.time() + self.ttl,
                    'owner': self.instance_id
                },
                ConditionExpression=Attr('lock_name').not_exists()
            )
            return True
        except ConditionalCheckFailedException:
            return False
    
    def release(self):
        self.table.delete_item(
            Key={'lock_name': self.lock_name},
            ConditionExpression=Attr('owner').eq(self.instance_id)
        )
```

**Leader Election:**
- One node coordinates others
- **Implementations**: Apache Zookeeper, etcd, DynamoDB-based
- **Considerations**: Split-brain scenarios, failover time

## Part II: Scalability and Performance Patterns

### 5. Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

#### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
- Add more power to existing machines
- **Advantages**: Simple, maintains consistency
- **Limitations**: Hardware limits, single point of failure
- **When to Use**: Initial phases, specialized workloads requiring large memory/CPU

#### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
- Add more machines to resource pool
- **Advantages**: No theoretical limits, better fault tolerance
- **Challenges**: Data partitioning, distributed coordination
- **When to Use**: Web traffic, data processing, stateless services

### 6. Data Partitioning Strategies

#### Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)

**Hash-Based Sharding:**
```python
def get_shard(user_id, num_shards):
    return hash(user_id) % num_shards

# Pros: Even distribution
# Cons: Difficult to rebalance, range queries expensive
```

**Range-Based Sharding:**
```python
def get_shard(timestamp, shard_ranges):
    for i, (start, end) in enumerate(shard_ranges):
        if start <= timestamp < end:
            return i
    return -1  # Error case

# Pros: Range queries efficient
# Cons: Hotspots possible, manual balancing needed
```

**Directory-Based Sharding:**
- Lookup service maintains shard mappings
- **Pros**: Flexible, easy to rebalance
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, potential bottleneck

#### Consistent Hashing
Essential for distributed caches and load balancing:

```python
import hashlib
import bisect

class ConsistentHash:
    def __init__(self, replicas=3):
        self.replicas = replicas
        self.ring = {}
        self.sorted_keys = []
    
    def add_node(self, node):
        for i in range(self.replicas):
            key = self._hash(f"{node}:{i}")
            self.ring[key] = node
            self.sorted_keys.append(key)
        self.sorted_keys.sort()
    
    def get_node(self, key):
        hash_key = self._hash(key)
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(self.sorted_keys, hash_key)
        if idx == len(self.sorted_keys):
            idx = 0
        return self.ring[self.sorted_keys[idx]]
    
    def _hash(self, key):
        return int(hashlib.md5(key.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)
```

### 7. Caching Strategies

#### Cache Patterns

**Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):**
```python
def get_user_profile(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    profile = cache.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if profile is None:
        # Cache miss - load from database
        profile = database.get_user(user_id)
        cache.set(f"user:{user_id}", profile, ttl=3600)
    return profile
```
- **Pros**: Only cache requested data
- **Cons**: Cache miss penalty, stale data possible

**Write-Through:**
```python
def update_user_profile(user_id, profile):
    # Update database first
    database.update_user(user_id, profile)
    # Then update cache
    cache.set(f"user:{user_id}", profile, ttl=3600)
```
- **Pros**: Cache always consistent
- **Cons**: Higher write latency

**Write-Behind (Write-Back):**
- Cache accepts write, asynchronously updates database
- **Pros**: Fast write operations
- **Cons**: Risk of data loss, complex consistency management

#### Cache Invalidation

**TTL (Time-To-Live):**
- Simple but can serve stale data
- Good for: Relatively static data with acceptable staleness

**Event-Based Invalidation:**
```python
# When user updates profile
def update_user_profile(user_id, profile):
    database.update_user(user_id, profile)
    # Invalidate cached entry
    cache.delete(f"user:{user_id}")
    # Notify other services
    publish_event("user_profile_updated", {"user_id": user_id})
```

**Cache Tags:**
- Associate cache entries with tags for bulk invalidation
- Useful for: Related data that changes together

### 8. Load Balancing Strategies

#### Load Balancing Algorithms

**Round Robin:**
- Simple distribution across servers
- **Good for**: Equal capacity servers, stateless applications

**Weighted Round Robin:**
- Distribute based on server capacity
- **Good for**: Heterogeneous server environments

**Least Connections:**
- Route to server with fewest active connections
- **Good for**: Long-lived connections, varying request processing times

**Consistent Hashing:**
- Route based on request characteristics
- **Good for**: Sticky sessions, cache locality

#### Health Checking and Circuit Breaking

```python
import time
from enum import Enum

class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = 1     # Normal operation
    OPEN = 2       # Failing, reject requests
    HALF_OPEN = 3  # Testing recovery

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = 0
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
    
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time >= self.recovery_timeout:
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit breaker is OPEN")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise e
    
    def _on_success(self):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
    
    def _on_failure(self):
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = CircuitState.OPEN
```

## Part III: Microservices and Service Communication

### 9. Service Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Communication

**HTTP/REST:**
- Simple, widely understood
- **Best for**: CRUD operations, public APIs
- **Challenges**: Tight coupling, cascading failures

**gRPC:**
- High-performance, type-safe
- **Best for**: Internal service-to-service communication
- **Features**: Streaming, load balancing, circuit breaking

#### Asynchronous Communication

**Message Queues:**
```python
# Amazon SQS example
import boto3

sqs = boto3.client('sqs')

def publish_order_event(order_id, event_type):
    message = {
        'order_id': order_id,
        'event_type': event_type,
        'timestamp': time.time()
    }
    
    sqs.send_message(
        QueueUrl='order-events-queue',
        MessageBody=json.dumps(message),
        MessageAttributes={
            'event_type': {
                'StringValue': event_type,
                'DataType': 'String'
            }
        }
    )

def process_order_events():
    while True:
        response = sqs.receive_message(
            QueueUrl='order-events-queue',
            MaxNumberOfMessages=10,
            WaitTimeSeconds=20
        )
        
        for message in response.get('Messages', []):
            try:
                process_message(message['Body'])
                sqs.delete_message(
                    QueueUrl='order-events-queue',
                    ReceiptHandle=message['ReceiptHandle']
                )
            except Exception as e:
                # Message will become visible again after timeout
                logger.error(f"Failed to process message: {e}")
```

**Event Streaming:**
- Real-time event processing
- **Technologies**: Amazon Kinesis, Apache Kafka
- **Use Cases**: Analytics, real-time recommendations, audit logs

### 10. Data Management in Microservices

#### Database per Service Pattern

**Advantages:**
- Service autonomy and independence
- Technology diversity (polyglot persistence)
- Independent scaling and optimization

**Challenges:**
- Data consistency across services
- Complex queries spanning services
- Data duplication and synchronization

#### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

```python
class OrderSaga:
    def __init__(self):
        self.steps = [
            ('inventory', self.reserve_inventory, self.release_inventory),
            ('payment', self.charge_payment, self.refund_payment),
            ('shipping', self.create_shipment, self.cancel_shipment)
        ]
    
    def execute(self, order_id):
        completed_steps = []
        try:
            for step_name, action, compensation in self.steps:
                action(order_id)
                completed_steps.append((step_name, compensation))
        except Exception as e:
            # Compensate completed steps in reverse order
            for step_name, compensation in reversed(completed_steps):
                try:
                    compensation(order_id)
                except Exception as comp_error:
                    logger.error(f"Compensation failed for {step_name}: {comp_error}")
            raise e
    
    def reserve_inventory(self, order_id):
        # Reserve inventory logic
        pass
    
    def release_inventory(self, order_id):
        # Release reservation logic
        pass
```

#### Event Sourcing Pattern

Instead of storing current state, store sequence of events:

```python
class EventStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []
    
    def append_event(self, stream_id, event):
        self.events.append({
            'stream_id': stream_id,
            'event_id': str(uuid.uuid4()),
            'event_type': event.__class__.__name__,
            'event_data': event.to_dict(),
            'timestamp': time.time()
        })
    
    def get_events(self, stream_id, from_version=0):
        return [e for e in self.events 
                if e['stream_id'] == stream_id and 
                e['version'] >= from_version]

class OrderAggregate:
    def __init__(self, order_id):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.status = 'PENDING'
        self.items = []
        self.version = 0
    
    def add_item(self, item):
        event = OrderItemAdded(self.order_id, item)
        self.apply(event)
        return event
    
    def apply(self, event):
        if isinstance(event, OrderItemAdded):
            self.items.append(event.item)
        elif isinstance(event, OrderConfirmed):
            self.status = 'CONFIRMED'
        self.version += 1
```

## Part IV: Fault Tolerance and Reliability

### 11. Failure Modes and Resilience Patterns

#### Common Failure Types

**Fail-Stop Failures:**
- Service stops responding completely
- **Detection**: Health checks, timeouts
- **Recovery**: Restart, failover to backup

**Byzantine Failures:**
- Service behaves incorrectly or maliciously
- **Detection**: Cross-validation, consensus
- **Recovery**: Complex, requires redundancy

**Network Partitions:**
- Services can't communicate
- **Detection**: Partition detection algorithms
- **Recovery**: Split-brain prevention, eventual healing

#### Resilience Patterns

**Retry with Backoff:**
```python
import random
import time

def exponential_backoff_retry(func, max_retries=3, base_delay=1, max_delay=60):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            
            delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)
            jitter = random.uniform(0, delay * 0.1)
            time.sleep(delay + jitter)
```

**Bulkhead Pattern:**
- Isolate resources to prevent cascading failures
- **Implementation**: Separate thread pools, connection pools
- **Example**: Different thread pools for critical vs non-critical operations

**Timeout Pattern:**
```python
import signal

class TimeoutError(Exception):
    pass

def timeout_handler(signum, frame):
    raise TimeoutError("Operation timed out")

def with_timeout(func, timeout_seconds):
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
    signal.alarm(timeout_seconds)
    try:
        result = func()
        signal.alarm(0)  # Cancel alarm
        return result
    except TimeoutError:
        signal.alarm(0)
        raise
```

### 12. Monitoring and Observability

#### The Three Pillars

**Logging:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Centralized log aggregation
- **Tools**: CloudWatch Logs, ELK Stack, Splunk

**Metrics:**
- Business metrics (orders/minute, revenue)
- Application metrics (response time, error rate)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Tools**: CloudWatch, Prometheus, DataDog

**Tracing:**
- Distributed request tracing
- Understanding request flow across services
- **Tools**: AWS X-Ray, Jaeger, Zipkin

#### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

```python
# Example SLO definitions
SLOs = {
    'api_availability': {
        'target': 99.9,  # 99.9% availability
        'measurement_window': '30d',
        'error_budget': 0.1  # 0.1% downtime allowed
    },
    'api_latency_p99': {
        'target': 500,  # 500ms P99 latency
        'measurement_window': '7d',
        'error_budget': 5  # 5% of requests can exceed target
    }
}

def calculate_error_budget_burn_rate(slo_config, current_performance):
    """Calculate how quickly we're burning through error budget"""
    target = slo_config['target']
    error_budget = slo_config['error_budget']
    
    if slo_config['target'] < 100:  # Availability SLO
        current_error_rate = 100 - current_performance
        burn_rate = current_error_rate / error_budget
    else:  # Latency SLO
        violations = max(0, current_performance - target)
        burn_rate = violations / (target * error_budget / 100)
    
    return burn_rate
```

## Part V: Interview Scenarios and Leadership Application

### 13. System Design Interview Framework

#### L6/L7 Interview Expectations

**L6 Expectations:**
- Design systems for 10M+ users
- Understand trade-offs between different approaches
- Explain decisions clearly to both technical and business stakeholders
- Consider operational concerns (monitoring, debugging, deployment)

**L7 Expectations:**
- Design systems for 100M+ users globally
- Make architectural decisions considering business strategy
- Plan for technology evolution and team scaling
- Balance innovation with operational excellence

#### Sample Interview Scenario: Design Amazon's Recommendation System

**Step 1: Clarifying Requirements (5 minutes)**
```
Candidate Questions:
- What types of recommendations? (product, content, ads)
- Scale: How many users and products?
- Real-time vs batch processing requirements?
- Personalization vs popularity-based?
- Budget/cost constraints?

Sample Requirements:
- 500M active users globally
- 100M products across categories
- Mix of real-time and batch processing
- Highly personalized recommendations
- Sub-100ms response time for API calls
```

**Step 2: High-Level Architecture (10 minutes)**
```
Components:
1. Data Ingestion Pipeline
   - User behavior events (views, purchases, ratings)
   - Product catalog updates
   - Real-time event streaming (Kinesis)

2. Feature Engineering
   - User features (demographics, history, preferences)
   - Product features (category, price, ratings)
   - Contextual features (time, location, device)

3. Model Training and Serving
   - Offline training (collaborative filtering, deep learning)
   - Online model serving (low latency inference)
   - A/B testing framework

4. Recommendation API
   - Cache frequently requested recommendations
   - Fallback to popularity-based recommendations
   - Rate limiting and circuit breakers
```

**Step 3: Deep Dive on Data Storage (10 minutes)**
```
Storage Requirements:
- User profiles: ~500M users × 1KB = 500GB
- Product catalog: ~100M products × 2KB = 200GB
- User-item interactions: ~50B interactions × 100B = 5TB
- Precomputed recommendations: ~500M users × 50 recs × 100B = 2.5TB

Storage Design:
- DynamoDB for user profiles (global tables for multi-region)
- S3 + Athena for historical interaction data
- ElastiCache for hot recommendation cache
- Feature store for ML features (SageMaker Feature Store)
```

**Step 4: Handling Scale and Performance (10 minutes)**
```
Scaling Strategies:
1. Horizontal partitioning by user_id
2. CDN for static recommendation lists
3. Precomputation for popular recommendation types
4. Real-time personalization for high-value users only

Performance Optimizations:
- Cache recommendations at multiple levels
- Use approximate algorithms for real-time computation
- Async model updates with graceful degradation
- Geographic distribution of services
```

**Step 5: Reliability and Monitoring (5 minutes)**
```
Failure Modes:
- Model serving failures → Fallback to cached recommendations
- Feature service outage → Use simplified feature set
- Database unavailability → Serve popular items

Monitoring:
- Recommendation CTR and conversion rates
- Model prediction accuracy and drift
- API latency and availability
- Feature freshness and data quality
```

### 14. Leadership Principles Integration

#### Customer Obsession in Distributed Systems
```
Scenario: Database performance degradation affecting checkout
L6/L7 Response:
1. Immediate: Implement circuit breakers to fail fast vs slow responses
2. Short-term: Add read replicas and implement caching
3. Long-term: Redesign for better customer experience during failures
Key Point: Technical decisions driven by customer impact, not technical elegance
```

#### Ownership in System Design
```
Scenario: Designing cross-team service dependencies
L6/L7 Approach:
1. Design for graceful degradation when dependencies fail
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. Create runbooks and automated recovery procedures
4. Take responsibility for end-to-end system reliability

### 16. Security in Distributed Systems

#### Authentication and Authorization

**OAuth 2.0 and JWT Tokens:**
```python
import jwt
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class TokenService:
    def __init__(self, issuer):
        # SECURITY: Never hardcode secrets - always use environment variables
        self.secret_key = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET_KEY')
        if not self.secret_key:
            raise ValueError("JWT_SECRET_KEY environment variable must be set")
        self.issuer = issuer
    
    def generate_token(self, user_id, roles, expires_in=3600):
        # SECURITY: Keep token expiration time short (default 1 hour)
        # For refresh tokens, use longer expiration with secure storage
        payload = {
            'user_id': user_id,
            'roles': roles,
            'iss': self.issuer,
            'iat': datetime.utcnow(),
            'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=expires_in),
            'jti': str(uuid.uuid4())  # Unique token ID for revocation tracking
        }
        return jwt.encode(payload, self.secret_key, algorithm='HS256')
    
    def verify_token(self, token):
        try:
            # SECURITY: Always specify allowed algorithms to prevent algorithm confusion attacks
            payload = jwt.decode(token, self.secret_key, 
                               algorithms=['HS256'], issuer=self.issuer)
            
            # SECURITY: Additional validation for security-critical systems
            if 'jti' in payload:
                # Check if token is revoked in Redis/database
                if self._is_token_revoked(payload['jti']):
                    raise Exception("Token has been revoked")
            
            return payload
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            raise Exception("Token has expired")
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            raise Exception("Invalid token")
    
    def _is_token_revoked(self, jti):
        # Implementation would check against revoked token list
        # e.g., Redis SET or database table
        return False  # Placeholder implementation
```

**Service-to-Service Authentication:**
- mTLS for service mesh communication
- Service accounts with rotated credentials
- AWS IAM roles for service authentication

#### Data Protection

**Encryption at Rest:**
- Database encryption (RDS, DynamoDB)
- S3 server-side encryption
- Key management (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)

**Encryption in Transit:**
- TLS for all external communication
- mTLS for internal service communication
- Certificate management and rotation

### 17. Cost Optimization Patterns

#### Resource Right-Sizing
```python
# Example: Auto-scaling based on business metrics
class BusinessMetricScaler:
    def __init__(self, target_orders_per_instance=1000):
        self.target_orders_per_instance = target_orders_per_instance
    
    def calculate_required_instances(self, current_orders_per_minute):
        # Convert to hourly and add buffer
        hourly_orders = current_orders_per_minute * 60
        required_instances = math.ceil(hourly_orders / self.target_orders_per_instance)
        
        # Add 20% buffer for traffic spikes
        return int(required_instances * 1.2)
    
    def get_scaling_decision(self, current_instances, current_load):
        required = self.calculate_required_instances(current_load)
        
        if required > current_instances * 1.5:
            return f"SCALE_UP to {required} instances"
        elif required < current_instances * 0.7:
            return f"SCALE_DOWN to {required} instances"
        else:
            return "NO_CHANGE"
```

#### Data Lifecycle Management
- S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- Data archival strategies (Glacier, Deep Archive)
- Automated cleanup of temporary data

### 18. Performance Optimization Techniques

#### Database Optimization

**Read Replicas and Sharding:**
```python
class DatabaseRouter:
    def __init__(self, master_conn, read_replicas, shard_config):
        self.master = master_conn
        self.read_replicas = read_replicas
        self.shard_config = shard_config
    
    def execute_query(self, query, params=None, read_only=False):
        if read_only:
            # Round-robin across read replicas
            replica = random.choice(self.read_replicas)
            return replica.execute(query, params)
        else:
            # All writes go to master
            return self.master.execute(query, params)
    
    def execute_sharded_query(self, shard_key, query, params=None):
        shard_id = self.get_shard_id(shard_key)
        connection = self.get_shard_connection(shard_id)
        return connection.execute(query, params)
    
    def get_shard_id(self, shard_key):
        return hash(shard_key) % self.shard_config['num_shards']
```

**Connection Pooling:**
```python
import threading
from queue import Queue

class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, connection_factory, min_connections=5, max_connections=20):
        self.factory = connection_factory
        self.min_connections = min_connections
        self.max_connections = max_connections
        self.pool = Queue(maxsize=max_connections)
        self.active_connections = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        
        # Pre-populate minimum connections
        for _ in range(min_connections):
            self.pool.put(self.factory())
            self.active_connections += 1
    
    def get_connection(self):
        try:
            # Try to get existing connection
            return self.pool.get_nowait()
        except:
            # Create new connection if under limit
            with self.lock:
                if self.active_connections < self.max_connections:
                    self.active_connections += 1
                    return self.factory()
                else:
                    # Wait for available connection
                    return self.pool.get()
    
    def return_connection(self, connection):
        if connection.is_healthy():
            self.pool.put(connection)
        else:
            with self.lock:
                self.active_connections -= 1
```
