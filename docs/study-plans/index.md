```python
def select_study_plan(weeks_available, current_level, risk_tolerance):
    if weeks_available <= 2:
        return "emergency" if risk_tolerance == "high" else "postpone_interview"
    elif weeks_available <= 6:
        return "intensive" if current_level >= "senior_engineer" else "comprehensive"
    elif weeks_available <= 12:
        return "strategic"
    else:
        return "comprehensive" if current_level >= "manager" else "career_transition"
```
