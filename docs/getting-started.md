## Step 4: Understand Core Success Factors

### The #1 Success Factor: Behavioral Excellence

**What Amazon Really Wants:**
- **Authentic stories** demonstrating leadership growth over time

- **Deep understanding** of Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles
- **Natural storytelling** that doesn't sound rehearsed

### Essential Story Portfolio
You need strong STAR stories for these core scenarios:
1. **Technical Leadership** - Major system design or architecture decision
2. **People Leadership** - Team transformation or conflict resolution  
3. **Cross-Functional Influence** - Working across departments/organizations
4. **Failure & Learning** - Significant failure and how you grew from it
5. **Innovation** - Something new you created or pioneered
