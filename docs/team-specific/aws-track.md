# AWS Team Preparation Track

## Overview

AWS is Amazon's crown jewel - a $80+ billion revenue business serving millions of customers globally. AWS engineers build and maintain the infrastructure that powers the internet, handling billions of requests daily across 200+ services.

## Team Culture & Environment

### Technical Excellence First
- **Ownership**: You own your service end-to-end - architecture, implementation, operations, and customer support
- **Operational Excellence**: 99.99%+ uptime expectations, sophisticated monitoring and alerting
- **Customer Obsession**: Direct customer feedback through support tickets, forums, and feature requests
- **Frugality**: Cost optimization is part of every design decision

### Work-Life Balance Reality
- **On-Call Rotation**: Typically 1 week every 6-8 weeks, 24/7 responsibility
- **Incident Response**: Pages can happen anytime, expected response within 15 minutes
- **Peak Seasons**: Black Friday, Prime Day, re:Invent create high-stress periods
- **Compensation Trade-off**: Higher pay compensates for demanding schedule

### Team Dynamics
- **Flat Hierarchy**: Senior engineers have significant autonomy
- **Fast-Paced**: Features ship weekly, infrastructure changes daily
- **Technical Depth**: Deep expertise valued over breadth
- **Innovation Culture**: Encouraged to experiment with new approaches
