# Behavioral Section Streamlining Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Content Audit Results
| File | Current Words | Current Scenarios | Status |
|------|:-------------:|:-----------------:|--------|
| **l6-scenarios.md** | 15,952 words | 20 scenarios | OVERWHELMING |
| **l7-scenarios.md** | 16,288 words | 17 scenarios | OVERWHELMING |
| **star-framework.md** | ~6,000 words | N/A | Good length |
| **behavioral/index.md** | ~3,000 words | N/A | Good length |
| **Other behavioral files** | ~5,668 words | Varies | Mixed |

**Total Current**: 46,908 words → **Target**: ~25,000 words (47% reduction)

### Problems Identified

1. **Cognitive Overload**: Single files with 15,000+ words are unusable
2. **Poor Navigation**: No way to find specific scenario types quickly
3. **Inconsistent Depth**: Some scenarios much longer than optimal
4. **Redundant Content**: Similar scenarios with different contexts
5. **Poor Mobile Experience**: Extremely long pages on mobile devices

## Streamlining Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Restructuring (Immediate)

#### New Behavioral File Structure
```
/behavioral/
├── index.md (overview + quick start - 1,500 words)
├── star-framework.md (keep as-is - 6,000 words)
├── l6-scenarios/
│   ├── index.md (overview + selection guide - 800 words)
│   ├── team-leadership.md (5 scenarios - 4,500 words)
│   ├── technical-decisions.md (5 scenarios - 4,500 words)  
│   ├── stakeholder-management.md (5 scenarios - 4,500 words)
│   └── crisis-performance.md (5 scenarios - 4,500 words)
├── l7-scenarios/
│   ├── index.md (overview + selection guide - 800 words)
│   ├── organizational-transformation.md (5 scenarios - 4,500 words)
│   ├── strategic-vision.md (4 scenarios - 3,600 words)
│   ├── executive-influence.md (4 scenarios - 3,600 words)
│   └── platform-ecosystems.md (4 scenarios - 3,600 words)
└── [other existing files remain but optimized]
```

#### Content Reduction Targets
- **L6 Scenarios**: 20 → 20 scenarios, but split across 4 focused files
- **L7 Scenarios**: 17 → 17 scenarios, but split across 4 focused files
- **Individual Scenarios**: Trim to 800-1,200 words each
- **Remove Redundancy**: Eliminate similar scenarios, keep the strongest

### Phase 2: Quality Optimization

#### Scenario Selection Criteria
**Keep scenarios that are**:
- ✅ Based on real Amazon interview questions
- ✅ Demonstrate multiple Leadership Principles clearly
- ✅ Include quantified business impact
- ✅ Show progression/growth over time
- ✅ Are commonly asked across interviews

**Remove or merge scenarios that are**:
- ❌ Too similar to other scenarios
- ❌ Overly theoretical or generic
- ❌ Lack clear business impact
- ❌ Don't align well with Amazon Leadership Principles
- ❌ Are rarely asked in actual interviews

#### Individual Scenario Optimization
**Current Average**: ~900 words per scenario
**Target Range**: 800-1,200 words per scenario

**Streamlining Approach**:
1. **Tighten STAR responses** - more concise but still comprehensive
2. **Reduce repetitive explanations** - focus on unique value
3. **Combine similar follow-up questions** - avoid redundancy
4. **Streamline success factors** - 3-4 key points maximum
5. **Remove excessive context** - keep essential details only
