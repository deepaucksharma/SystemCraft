## Content Creation Guidelines

### Before Creating New Content

1. **Assess Content Type:** Determine which template best fits your content goal
   - **Learning goal:** Use Tutorial Template
   - **Understanding goal:** Use Guide Template  
   - **Reference/lookup goal:** Use Reference Template
   - **Situational application:** Use Scenario Template

2. **Check for Existing Content:** Search for similar or overlapping content to avoid duplication

3. **Define Success Criteria:** Know what user success looks like for your content

### Template Usage Standards

#### File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case: `my-content-title.md`
- Include date prefixes for time-sensitive content: `2025-behavioral-trends.md`
- Use clear categorization prefixes: `l6-system-design-guide.md`

#### Content Quality Standards
- **User-centered:** Write for the reader's needs and context
- **Actionable:** Provide clear steps and outcomes
- **Measurable:** Include success criteria and validation methods
- **Connected:** Link to related content and learning paths

#### Cross-Reference Guidelines
- Use absolute paths in links: `/fundamentals/leadership-principles.md`
- Include bidirectional linking with "Related Content" sections
- Add context to links: `[Leadership Principles Guide](link) - Comprehensive LP coverage`

## Customization Guidelines

### Adapting Templates

#### For Different Experience Levels
- **L6 Content:** Focus on team leadership and technical depth
- **L7 Content:** Emphasize organizational impact and strategic thinking
- **Foundational Content:** Provide extra context and prerequisites

#### For Different Content Areas
- **Technical Content:** Emphasize code examples, complexity analysis, system design
- **Behavioral Content:** Focus on STAR framework, leadership principles, real scenarios
