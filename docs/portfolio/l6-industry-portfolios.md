        await self.kafka_producer.send(
            'inventory-updates',
            value=event.to_dict(),
            key=event.sku
        )
        
        # Trigger replication to other regions if quantity < threshold
        if event.quantity < REBALANCE_THRESHOLD:
            await self.trigger_inventory_rebalancing(event.sku)
```

**Distributed Payment Processing:**
```python
class PaymentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.saga = SagaOrchestrator()
    
    async def process_payment(self, order_id, payment_info):
        saga_id = f"payment-{order_id}"
        
        # Define compensation steps for rollback
        steps = [
            ("reserve_inventory", self.inventory_service.reserve),
            ("process_payment", self.payment_service.charge),
            ("create_fulfillment", self.fulfillment_service.create_order),
            ("send_confirmation", self.notification_service.send)
        ]
