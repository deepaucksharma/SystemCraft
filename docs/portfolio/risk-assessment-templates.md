### Technical Debt Quantification Model

#### 1. Code Quality Debt

**Metrics Collection:**
```python
class CodeQualityMetrics:
    def calculate_code_debt_score(self, repository_analysis):
        # Complexity metrics
        cyclomatic_complexity = repository_analysis.average_cyclomatic_complexity
        complexity_debt = max(0, (cyclomatic_complexity - 10) * 100)  # Target: <10
        
        # Coverage metrics  
        test_coverage = repository_analysis.test_coverage_percentage
        coverage_debt = max(0, (80 - test_coverage) * 50)  # Target: 80%+
        
        # Duplication metrics
        code_duplication = repository_analysis.duplication_percentage
        duplication_debt = code_duplication * 200  # High penalty for duplication
        
        # Documentation debt
        documentation_coverage = repository_analysis.documentation_coverage
        documentation_debt = max(0, (70 - documentation_coverage) * 30)
        
        # Security debt
        security_vulnerabilities = repository_analysis.security_scan_results
        security_debt = (
            security_vulnerabilities.critical * 1000 +
            security_vulnerabilities.high * 500 +
            security_vulnerabilities.medium * 100
        )
        
        total_debt_score = (
            complexity_debt + coverage_debt + duplication_debt + 
            documentation_debt + security_debt
        )
        
        return CodeDebtAssessment(
            total_score=total_debt_score,
            complexity_component=complexity_debt,

```

**Example: E-commerce Platform Code Debt Analysis**
```
Codebase Analysis Results:
- Total lines of code: 500,000
- Average cyclomatic complexity: 15 (Target: <10)
- Test coverage: 65% (Target: 80%+)
- Code duplication: 12% (Target: <5%)
- Documentation coverage: 45% (Target: 70%+)
- Security vulnerabilities: 15 critical, 45 high, 120 medium

Code Debt Score Calculation:
- Complexity debt: (15 - 10) × 100 = 500 points
- Coverage debt: (80 - 65) × 50 = 750 points
- Duplication debt: 12 × 200 = 2,400 points
- Documentation debt: (70 - 45) × 30 = 750 points
- Security debt: (15 × 1000) + (45 × 500) + (120 × 100) = 49,500 points
Total Code Debt Score: 54,900 points

Financial Impact:
- Estimated remediation effort: 3,660 hours
- Cost at $100/hour: $366,000
- Monthly productivity drag: 20% (based on debt score)
- Team of 15 engineers: 15 × $150K × 20% = $450,000 annually
- Total annual impact: $450,000 (productivity) + $366,000 (remediation) = $816,000
```

#### Risk Assessment Matrix

| **Threat Scenario** | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Current Controls** | **Control Effectiveness** | **Residual Risk** | **Financial Exposure** |
|---------------------|----------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Data Breach (PII)** | High (75%) | Critical | Encryption, Access Controls, Monitoring | Medium (60%) | High | $50M+ (fines, lawsuits, reputation) |
| **Payment Fraud** | High (80%) | High | Fraud detection, Transaction monitoring | High (80%) | Medium | $10M annually |
| **Ransomware Attack** | Medium (40%) | Critical | Backups, Network segmentation, Training | Medium (65%) | High | $25M (downtime + ransom + recovery) |
| **Insider Threat** | Medium (30%) | High | Background checks, Access logging, Segregation | Low (40%) | High | $15M (fraud + IP theft) |
| **API Security Breach** | High (70%) | High | API gateways, Rate limiting, Authentication | Medium (55%) | High | $20M (data exposure + system compromise) |
| **Third-Party Breach** | Medium (45%) | Medium | Vendor assessments, Contracts, Monitoring | Low (35%) | High | $8M (downstream impact) |

#### Risk Quantification Model

```python
class FinancialRiskCalculator:
    def calculate_annual_expected_loss(self, risk_scenarios):
        total_expected_loss = 0
        
        for scenario in risk_scenarios:
            # Calculate Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
            sle = scenario.asset_value * scenario.exposure_factor
            
            # Calculate Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
            aro = scenario.likelihood_percentage / 100
            
            # Calculate Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
            ale = sle * aro
            
            # Adjust for control effectiveness
            residual_ale = ale * (1 - scenario.control_effectiveness)

            confidence_level=0.85  # Based on historical data and expert judgment
        )
```

**Risk Calculation Example:**
```
Data Breach Risk Calculation:
- Asset Value: $100M (50M customers × $2K per record regulatory fine)
- Exposure Factor: 50% (estimated % of data compromised in typical breach)
- Single Loss Expectancy: $100M × 50% = $50M
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence: 75% (high likelihood)
- Gross Annual Loss Expectancy: $50M × 0.75 = $37.5M
- Control Effectiveness: 60%
- Residual Annual Loss Expectancy: $37.5M × (1 - 0.60) = $15M

Total Annual Expected Loss (All Scenarios): $28.4M
Risk Tolerance: $5M annually
Risk Treatment Required: $23.4M risk reduction needed

#### Scalability Risk Assessment

**Risk Level Calculation:**
```python
class ScalabilityRiskCalculator:
    def calculate_component_risk(self, component_analysis):
        # Risk factors
        capacity_gap_factor = min(component_analysis.capacity_gap / 100, 10)  # Cap at 10x
        time_to_critical_factor = max(0, (24 - component_analysis.months_to_critical) / 24)
        architecture_complexity_factor = component_analysis.refactoring_complexity / 10
        
        # Business impact factor
        business_criticality = component_analysis.business_criticality_score / 10
        revenue_impact_factor = component_analysis.potential_revenue_loss / 1000000  # Per million
        
        # Calculate composite risk score
        technical_risk = (capacity_gap_factor + time_to_critical_factor + architecture_complexity_factor) / 3
        business_risk = (business_criticality + revenue_impact_factor) / 2
        
        composite_risk = (technical_risk * 0.6) + (business_risk * 0.4)
        
        return ComponentRiskScore(
            technical_risk=technical_risk,

## Summary: Risk Management Best Practices

### Strategic Risk Management Framework

**1. Systematic Risk Identification**
- Use structured frameworks for each risk category
- Involve cross-functional teams in risk assessment
- Consider both technical and business dimensions
- Update risk assessments quarterly

**2. Quantitative Risk Analysis**
- Convert risks to financial terms where possible
- Use probability × impact calculations
- Account for risk interdependencies
- Include confidence intervals in estimates

**3. Risk Prioritization Matrix**
- Weight risks by business impact and likelihood
- Consider timeline to risk realization
- Factor in mitigation costs and feasibility
- Balance short-term fixes with strategic solutions

**4. Mitigation Strategy Development**
- Create multiple mitigation options for high risks
- Include preventive and reactive measures
- Plan for risk monitoring and early warning systems
- Design contingency plans for critical risks

**5. Investment ROI Justification**
- Calculate risk reduction value
- Include opportunity costs of inaction
- Factor in insurance and compliance benefits
- Present multiple scenarios (best/worst/likely case)

### Interview Presentation Strategy

**For L6/L7 Risk Management Stories:**
- Lead with business context and impact
- Show systematic risk assessment methodology
- Quantify risks in financial terms
- Present multiple mitigation options with trade-offs
- Demonstrate monitoring and continuous improvement
- Include lessons learned and process improvements

**Key Questions to Prepare For:**
- "How did you identify and prioritize these risks?"
- "What was your framework for quantifying risk impact?"
- "How did you get organizational buy-in for risk investments?"
- "What monitoring systems did you put in place?"
- "How did you balance risk mitigation with business objectives?"
