#### Situation
Our e-commerce platform's order processing service was experiencing significant performance degradation during peak traffic periods. Response times increased from 200ms to 3+ seconds, causing cart abandonment rates to spike by 23%. The service handled 50,000 orders per day during normal periods but struggled with Black Friday traffic of 200,000+ orders per day. The existing monolithic order service had grown to handle multiple responsibilities including order validation, inventory checks, payment processing, and notification sending.
