### 2. Technical Decision Records (TDRs)

#### Decision Documentation Template
```markdown
**TDR Example: "Migration from Monolith to Microservices"**

**Decision Date**: Q2 2023
**Decision Makers**: Engineering leadership team (5 people)
**Stakeholders**: 3 product teams (25 engineers total)

**Context**:
- Monolithic application serving 20M users
- Development velocity declining due to codebase complexity
- Team conflicts over shared codebase and deployment dependencies
- Scaling challenges with different performance requirements per feature

**Options Considered**:
1. **Status Quo**: Continue with monolith, improve internal modularity
   - Pros: No migration risk, established operational knowledge
   - Cons: Scaling issues persist, team velocity continues declining

2. **Full Microservices**: Decompose into 15+ microservices
   - Pros: Team autonomy, independent scaling, technology diversity
   - Cons: High complexity, network latency, distributed system challenges

3. **Modular Monolith**: Improve internal boundaries, selective extraction
   - Pros: Lower risk, gradual migration, operational simplicity
   - Cons: Limited team autonomy, still shared deployment

**Decision**: Gradual microservices extraction (hybrid approach)
- Start with highest-value, lowest-risk services
- Extract 3-5 core services over 18 months
- Maintain shared platform services (auth, logging, monitoring)

**Rationale**:
- Balances team autonomy needs with operational complexity
- Allows learning and iteration on microservices practices
- Reduces business risk through gradual migration
- Aligns with team growth plans (3 teams ‚Üí 5 teams)

**Implementation Plan**:
- Phase 1: Extract user service (lowest risk, clear boundaries)
- Phase 2: Extract payment service (high value, regulatory isolation)
- Phase 3: Extract recommendation service (performance requirements)

**Results (12 months later)**:
- Successfully extracted 3 services with zero business impact
- Development velocity increased 35% (feature delivery time)
- Team satisfaction improved (autonomy scores: 3.2 ‚Üí 4.1/5)
- Operational complexity manageable (added 2 SRE team members)
- Learned patterns applied to remaining migration phases
```
