**Weighted Scores:**
- **Build Internal:** 6.85/10
- **Buy Commercial:** 6.32/10  
- **Open Source + Customize:** 6.15/10
- **Hybrid Approach:** 5.98/10

### Real-World Build vs Buy Examples

#### Example 1: Data Processing Platform

**Business Context:**
- Processing 500TB+ data daily across multiple business units
- Need for real-time and batch processing capabilities
- Compliance requirements (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA)
- 5-year strategic initiative

**Options Analysis:**

**Option 1: Build Custom Platform**
```
Costs (5-year):
- Development: 25 engineers × $200K × 2 years = $10M
- Ongoing maintenance: 8 engineers × $200K × 3 years = $4.8M
- Infrastructure: $2M annually × 5 years = $10M
- Total TCO: $24.8M

Benefits:
+ Perfect fit for specific requirements
+ Full control over features and performance  
+ No vendor lock-in
+ Competitive differentiation

Risks:
- High execution risk (complex distributed systems)
- Long time to market (18-24 months)
- Talent acquisition challenges
- Opportunity cost of engineering resources
```

**Option 2: Buy Enterprise Solution (Databricks)**
```  
Costs (5-year):
- License: $3M annually × 5 years = $15M
- Implementation: $2M
- Ongoing support: $500K annually × 5 years = $2.5M
- Customization: $1.5M
- Total TCO: $21M

Benefits:
+ Fast implementation (3-6 months)
+ Proven scalability and reliability
+ Rich ecosystem and integrations
+ Reduced maintenance burden
+ Enterprise support

Risks:
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited customization
- Ongoing license costs
- Feature gaps for specific use cases
```

**Decision Matrix Application:**
```python
# Weighted scoring example
build_score = (
    (6 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.05) + (7 * 0.07) + (4 * 0.05) +  # Financial
    (10 * 0.10) + (9 * 0.08) + (8 * 0.07) + (3 * 0.05) + # Technical  
    (10 * 0.10) + (10 * 0.08) + (10 * 0.07) +            # Strategic
    (4 * 0.08) + (8 * 0.05) + (6 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.03)    # Risk
) = 6.85

buy_score = 6.32 (calculated similarly)

# Recommendation: Build (6.85 > 6.32)
# Primary drivers: Strategic value (competitive differentiation, IP ownership)
# Key risks: Execution complexity, time to market
```

**Final Recommendation:** Hybrid approach
- Build core processing engine for competitive differentiation
- Use managed cloud services for infrastructure (reducing TCO by $3M)
- Buy specialized components for compliance and monitoring
- **Result:** Achieved best-of-both-worlds with 40% faster time to market

#### Example 2: Authentication & Authorization Platform

**Business Context:**
- Support for 100M+ users across multiple products
- OAuth2, SAML, MFA, and custom authentication methods
- Global deployment with <100ms latency requirements
- Security and compliance critical

**Decision Process:**
```
Option 1: Build Custom (Auth0 equivalent)
- Engineering cost: $15M over 24 months
- Ongoing maintenance: $5M annually
- Score: 7.2/10 (high on control, low on speed)

Option 2: Auth0 Enterprise  
- 5-year cost: $8M in licenses + $2M implementation = $10M
- Score: 8.1/10 (high on reliability, medium on customization)

Option 3: AWS Cognito + Custom Components
- 5-year cost: $3M infrastructure + $4M custom development = $7M  
- Score: 8.4/10 (balanced approach)

Decision: AWS Cognito + Custom Components
Rationale: 
- 30% cost savings vs pure build
- 50% faster implementation
- Leverages AWS ecosystem integration
- Maintains control over critical differentiators
```

## Summary: Technology Decision Best Practices

### Decision Framework Implementation

**1. Define Evaluation Criteria Upfront**
- Weight criteria based on business priorities
- Include technical, financial, strategic, and risk factors
- Get stakeholder agreement on weightings before evaluation

**2. Use Data-Driven Scoring**
- Benchmark performance with realistic load testing
- Calculate total cost of ownership over 3-5 years
- Assess organizational readiness honestly

**3. Document Decision Rationale**
- Create decision records for future reference
- Include alternatives considered and why rejected
- Document assumptions and their validation

**4. Plan for Implementation Success**
- Include team training and capability building
- Phase implementations to manage risk
- Define success metrics and monitoring

**5. Maintain Strategic Alignment**
- Connect technology decisions to business objectives
- Consider vendor relationships and strategic partnerships
- Plan for technology evolution and migration paths

### Interview Presentation Tips

**For L6/L7 Interviews:**
- Lead with business context and constraints
- Show systematic evaluation methodology
- Quantify costs, benefits, and risks
- Demonstrate strategic thinking beyond technical features
- Include organizational and team considerations
- Present alternatives and trade-off analysis
- Show results and lessons learned

**Common Questions to Prepare For:**
- "Walk me through your evaluation process"
- "What alternatives did you consider and why did you reject them?"
- "How did you get organizational buy-in for this decision?"
- "What would you do differently if you had to make this decision again?"
- "How did you measure success of this technology choice?"
