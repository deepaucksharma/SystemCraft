    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = 0
        self.state = 'CLOSED'  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == 'OPEN':
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = 'HALF_OPEN'
            else:
                raise CircuitOpenError()
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == 'HALF_OPEN':
                self.state = 'CLOSED'
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = 'OPEN'

```

### Common Interview Questions

#### "How do you ensure operational excellence in your systems?"
```markdown
**Strong Response Framework**:
1. **Monitoring**: "I implement comprehensive observability with SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets"
2. **Automation**: "All operational procedures are automated and tested regularly"
3. **Culture**: "We have a blame-free post-mortem culture focused on system improvements"
4. **Continuous Improvement**: "Regular operational reviews drive platform investments"

**Specific Examples**:
- Automated deployments with canary releases
- Self-healing systems with automated remediation
- Operational dashboards showing business impact

```

#### "How do you balance the six pillars when they conflict?"
```markdown
**Trade-off Analysis Example**:
"Security and performance often conflict. For example:
- **Encryption** adds latency but is required for data protection
- **Authentication** adds overhead but prevents unauthorized access
- **Audit logging** impacts performance but provides compliance

**Resolution Approach**:
- Measure the actual impact of security controls
- Implement efficient security patterns (connection pooling, caching)
- Use managed security services to reduce overhead
- Make security controls transparent to application logic"
