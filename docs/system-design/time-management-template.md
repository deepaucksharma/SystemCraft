# System Design Time Management Template

## ‚è∞ Strategic Time Allocation for L6/L7 System Design

System design interviews are time-constrained strategic exercises. Success requires disciplined time management, structured thinking, and clear communication. This template provides minute-by-minute guidance for 45, 60, and 90-minute sessions.

## üéØ Time Management Philosophy

### The 70-20-10 Rule
```markdown
70% - Core Design: Architecture, components, APIs
20% - Deep Dives: Scaling, reliability, specific challenges  
10% - Questions: Clarification and interviewer engagement

Never spend more than 20% of time on any single component.
```

### L6 vs L7 Time Priorities

#### L6 Focus (Execution Excellence)
```markdown
- Requirements clarification: 15%
- High-level architecture: 35%
- Detailed component design: 30%
- Scaling and reliability: 15%
- Questions and wrap-up: 5%
```

#### L7 Focus (Strategic Vision)
```markdown
- Business context and strategy: 20%
- Architecture and trade-offs: 40%
- Scalability and evolution: 25%
- Cross-cutting concerns: 10%
- Future vision: 5%
```

## üéØ Time Management Techniques

### The Pomodoro Approach
```markdown
**5-Minute Cycles:**
- Minutes 0-5: Requirements
- Minutes 5-10: Architecture  
- Minutes 10-15: Deep dive 1
- Minutes 15-20: Deep dive 2
- etc.

Set mental alarms for each 5-minute boundary.
```

### The Pyramid Method
```markdown
**Start Broad, Go Deep:**
1. Overview (top of pyramid)
2. Major components (middle)
3. Detailed subsystems (bottom)
4. Scaling considerations (foundation)

Spend equal time at each level.
```

### The Checkpoint Strategy
```markdown
**Regular Check-ins:**
- 25% mark: "Am I on track for basic design?"
- 50% mark: "Do I have enough detail?"
- 75% mark: "What critical areas am I missing?"
- 90% mark: "What questions should I ask?"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Time Management Pitfalls

### Time Wasters to Avoid
```markdown
‚ùå **Over-architecting early:** Don't design perfect APIs in minute 10
‚ùå **Rabbit holes:** Don't spend 15 minutes on authentication details
‚ùå **Technology debates:** Don't argue PostgreSQL vs MySQL for 10 minutes
‚ùå **Perfect diagrams:** Don't spend time making beautiful drawings
‚ùå **Implementation details:** Don't code algorithms on the whiteboard
```

### Time Savers to Leverage
```markdown
‚úÖ **Template phrases:** "Let's assume standard authentication..."
‚úÖ **Standard patterns:** Use well-known architectural patterns
‚úÖ **Defer details:** "We can discuss sharding strategies later"
‚úÖ **Time boxing:** "Let me spend 5 minutes on the API design"
‚úÖ **Summarizing:** Regularly summarize key decisions
```
