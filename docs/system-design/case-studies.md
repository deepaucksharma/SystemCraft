    def handle_write(self, item, consistency_level):
        # 1. Hash key to determine partition
        partition = self.consistent_hash(item.key)
        
        # 2. Find storage nodes for partition
        nodes = self.get_nodes_for_partition(partition)
        
        # 3. Write based on consistency level
        if consistency_level == "EVENTUAL":
            # Write to one node, replicate async
            primary = nodes[0]
            primary.write(item)
            self.replicate_async(item, nodes[1:])
        else:  # STRONG consistency
            # Write to majority before returning
            successful_writes = 0
            for node in nodes:
                if node.write(item):
                    successful_writes += 1
                if successful_writes > len(nodes) / 2:
