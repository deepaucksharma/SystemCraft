# System Design Fundamentals for Amazon L6/L7 Interviews

## üèóÔ∏è The Amazon System Design Reality

System design interviews at Amazon are not just about technical architecturethey're about demonstrating your ability to think at scale, make trade-offs under uncertainty, and design systems that embody Amazon's operational excellence. For L6/L7 candidates, the expectation is that you can design production-ready systems that serve millions to billions of users while considering cost, reliability, and maintainability.

!!! quote "2024 Candidate Insights"
    **L7 Success (September 2024):** "They didn't just want to see I could design a systemthey wanted to see I could design a system that would survive Amazon's scale and operational complexity."
    
    **L6 Feedback (November 2024):** "I focused too much on the perfect technical solution and not enough on the practical trade-offs. Amazon wants to see how you make decisions with incomplete information."

## üéØ Amazon's System Design Philosophy

### Core Principles for L6/L7 Design

#### 1. Customer Obsession in Architecture
```python
# Amazon's approach to system design prioritizes customer experience
customer_obsession_design = {
    "latency": "Single-digit milliseconds for critical paths",
    "availability": "99.99% for customer-facing services",
    "consistency": "Eventual consistency acceptable if UX benefits",
    "error_handling": "Graceful degradation over hard failures",
    "personalization": "Built-in from day one, not bolted on"
}

# Example: Design decisions for Prime Video streaming
design_decisions = {
    "CDN_strategy": "Edge locations globally for < 50ms latency",
    "adaptive_bitrate": "Quality adjusts to network conditions",
    "offline_viewing": "Download capability for poor connectivity",
    "error_recovery": "Seamless failover to different quality streams"
}
```

#### 2. Operational Excellence Framework
```markdown
**Amazon's Operational Excellence Pillars:**

1. **Design for Operations**
   - Every component has monitoring/alerting built-in
   - Automated deployment and rollback procedures
   - Clear ownership and on-call responsibilities
   - Runbooks for all failure scenarios

2. **Build for Scale**
   - Horizontal scaling as default approach
   - Stateless services and shared-nothing architecture
   - Database sharding strategies from day one
   - Queue-based asynchronous processing

3. **Embrace Failure**
   - Circuit breakers and bulkheads pattern
   - Chaos engineering and fault injection
   - Multi-region active-active architecture
   - Graceful degradation over hard failures

4. **Optimize Costs**
   - Resource-based pricing models
   - Auto-scaling based on demand patterns
   - Spot instances and reserved capacity optimization
   - Data lifecycle management and archival strategies
```

#### 3. Leadership Principles in Technical Design

**Ownership in System Design:**
- Design systems you can operate and maintain long-term
- Include monitoring, alerting, and debugging capabilities
- Plan for on-call burden and operational complexity
- Consider total cost of ownership, not just development cost

**Deliver Results Through Architecture:**
- Focus on business outcomes, not just technical elegance
- Design for measurable customer impact
- Include A/B testing and experimentation capabilities
- Plan for rapid iteration and feature development

## üèóÔ∏è Essential System Design Components

### 1. Load Balancing and Traffic Management

#### Amazon's Approach to Load Balancing
```markdown
**Application Load Balancer (ALB) Patterns:**
- Layer 7 routing based on content, headers, or path
- Health checks with custom endpoints and criteria
- Weighted routing for gradual traffic shifting
- Multi-target group routing for blue-green deployments

**Network Load Balancer (NLB) for High Performance:**
- Layer 4 routing for ultra-low latency requirements
- Static IP addresses for whitelisting scenarios
- Cross-zone load balancing for availability
- Connection draining for graceful scaling

**Global Load Balancing with Route 53:**
- Geolocation routing for compliance requirements
- Latency-based routing for performance optimization
- Health checks with fallback regions
- Weighted policies for traffic splitting
```

#### Real-World Example: E-commerce Platform Load Balancing
```yaml
# Production load balancing configuration for L6 scale
load_balancer_architecture:
  global_dns:
    primary_region: "us-east-1"
    secondary_region: "us-west-2"
    health_check_interval: "30s"
    failover_threshold: "3_consecutive_failures"
  
  application_tier:
    alb_configuration:
      target_groups:
        - web_servers: "weight: 80"
        - mobile_api: "weight: 20"
      health_check: "/health"
      deregistration_delay: "300s"
  
  auto_scaling:
    min_capacity: 4
    max_capacity: 100
    target_cpu_utilization: 70
    scale_out_cooldown: "300s"
    scale_in_cooldown: "300s"
```

### 2. Database Design and Data Management

#### Choosing the Right Database for Amazon Scale

```markdown
**RDS vs DynamoDB Decision Matrix:**

| Requirement | RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL) | DynamoDB |
|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| **ACID Transactions** |  Full ACID compliance | L Limited transaction support |
| **Complex Queries** |  SQL, joins, aggregations | L Simple key-value queries only |
| **Scaling** | L Vertical scaling limits |  Automatic horizontal scaling |
| **Performance** | L I/O bound, predictable load |  Single-digit millisecond latency |
| **Cost at Scale** | L Expensive for large datasets |  Pay-per-request pricing |
| **Operational Burden** | L Requires tuning and maintenance |  Fully managed |

**Decision Framework:**
- Use RDS for: Financial systems, complex reporting, existing SQL workflows
- Use DynamoDB for: User sessions, gaming leaderboards, IoT data, real-time applications
- Use both: CQRS pattern with RDS for writes, DynamoDB for reads
```

#### Database Sharding Strategies for L6/L7 Scale

```python
# Horizontal sharding implementation example
class ShardingStrategy:
    def __init__(self, num_shards=16):
        self.num_shards = num_shards
        self.shard_map = {}
    
    def get_shard_key(self, user_id):
        """Consistent hashing for user data distribution"""
        return hash(user_id) % self.num_shards
    
    def get_database_connection(self, shard_key):
        """Return appropriate database connection for shard"""
        return f"user_db_shard_{shard_key}"
    
    def cross_shard_query(self, query_params):
        """Handle queries that span multiple shards"""
        results = []
        for shard in range(self.num_shards):
            shard_result = self.query_shard(shard, query_params)
            results.extend(shard_result)
        return self.merge_results(results)

# L6 Challenge: Design for 10M users
# L7 Challenge: Design for 1B+ users with global distribution
```

### 3. Caching Architecture

#### Multi-Layer Caching Strategy

```markdown
**Amazon's Caching Hierarchy:**

1. **CDN Layer (CloudFront)**
   - Static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript)
   - API responses with appropriate TTL
   - Geographic distribution for global latency
   - Cache invalidation strategies

2. **Application-Level Caching (ElastiCache)**
   - Redis for complex data structures and pub/sub
   - Memcached for simple key-value caching
   - Cluster mode for high availability
   - Cache-aside vs write-through patterns

3. **Database Query Caching**
   - Query result caching for expensive operations
   - Materialized views for complex aggregations
   - Database connection pooling
   - Query optimization and indexing strategies

**Cache Invalidation Strategies:**
- Time-based TTL for frequently changing data
- Event-driven invalidation for critical updates
- Cache versioning for gradual rollouts
- Cache warming for predictable traffic patterns
```

#### Real-World Caching Implementation
```json
{
  "caching_strategy": {
    "user_profile": {
      "cache_type": "Redis",
      "ttl": "1_hour",
      "invalidation": "user_update_event",
      "backup_strategy": "database_fallback"
    },
    "product_catalog": {
      "cache_type": "CloudFront + ElastiCache",
      "ttl": "24_hours",
      "invalidation": "inventory_change_event",
      "warming_strategy": "scheduled_job_4am"
    },
    "search_results": {
      "cache_type": "Elasticsearch + Redis",
      "ttl": "15_minutes",
      "invalidation": "content_update_event",
      "personalization": "user_based_cache_keys"
    }
  },
  "performance_targets": {
    "cache_hit_ratio": "> 95%",
    "cache_latency": "< 1ms",
    "fallback_latency": "< 100ms"
  }
}
```

### 4. Microservices Architecture and Communication

#### Service Decomposition Strategy

```markdown
**Amazon's Microservices Principles:**

1. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each service owns one business capability
   - Clear boundaries and minimal coupling
   - Independent deployment and scaling
   - Team ownership and accountability

2. **Database per Service**
   - No shared databases between services
   - Data consistency through event sourcing
   - SAGA pattern for distributed transactions
   - API contracts for data access

3. **Fault Isolation**
   - Circuit breaker pattern implementation
   - Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
   - Timeout and retry configurations
   - Graceful degradation strategies

**Service Communication Patterns:**
- Synchronous: REST APIs for real-time operations
- Asynchronous: SQS/SNS for eventual consistency
- Event sourcing: Event store for audit trails
- CQRS: Separate read/write models for optimization
```

#### Inter-Service Communication Example
```yaml
# Microservices communication architecture
services:
  user_service:
    responsibilities:
      - User authentication and authorization
      - Profile management
      - Preference settings
    apis:
      - POST /users/authenticate
      - GET /users/{user_id}/profile
      - PUT /users/{user_id}/preferences
    
  order_service:
    responsibilities:
      - Order creation and management
      - Payment processing coordination
      - Order history and tracking
    dependencies:
      - user_service: "user authentication"
      - inventory_service: "stock validation"
      - payment_service: "payment processing"
    
  notification_service:
    responsibilities:
      - Email and SMS notifications
      - Push notification management
      - Notification preferences
    communication_pattern: "event_driven"
    message_queues:
      - order_events: "SQS queue for order updates"
      - user_events: "SNS topic for user changes"
```

## <ÔøΩ Amazon-Specific System Design Patterns

### 1. The "Everything is an API" Pattern

```markdown
**Amazon's API-First Philosophy:**

Every system component should be accessible via well-defined APIs:
- Internal teams consume APIs just like external customers
- Versioning strategy for backward compatibility
- Rate limiting and authentication for all APIs
- Comprehensive documentation and SDK generation

**API Design Principles:**
1. **RESTful when possible, GraphQL when complex**
2. **Idempotent operations for reliability**
3. **Consistent error handling and status codes**
4. **Comprehensive monitoring and analytics**
5. **Security by default (HTTPS, authentication, authorization)**
```

### 2. The "Two-Pizza Team" Architecture Pattern

```python
# Service architecture for independent team ownership
team_service_architecture = {
    "team_size": "6-8 engineers",
    "service_ownership": "full_lifecycle",
    "deployment_independence": True,
    "technology_choice_freedom": True,
    "operational_responsibility": "24/7_on_call",
    
    "boundaries": {
        "data_ownership": "exclusive_database_access",
        "api_contracts": "backward_compatible_versioning",
        "deployment_pipeline": "independent_ci_cd",
        "monitoring": "team_specific_dashboards"
    },
    
    "communication": {
        "sync_apis": "real_time_operations",
        "async_events": "eventual_consistency",
        "shared_nothing": "no_direct_database_access"
    }
}
```

### 3. The "Backwards Compatibility" Pattern

```markdown
**API Evolution Strategy:**

1. **Additive Changes Only**
   - New fields can be added to responses
   - New optional parameters can be added to requests
   - New endpoints can be added to existing services

2. **Deprecation Timeline**
   - Announce deprecation 6 months in advance
   - Provide migration guides and tools
   - Monitor usage and assist remaining clients
   - Remove deprecated functionality after 12 months

3. **Versioning Strategy**
   - URL versioning: /v1/users, /v2/users
   - Header versioning: API-Version: 2.0
   - Content negotiation: Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=2

**Example: User Service API Evolution**
```
# Version 1.0
GET /v1/users/{id}
Response: {"id": 123, "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}

# Version 2.0 (Backwards Compatible)
GET /v1/users/{id}
Response: {"id": 123, "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com", "preferences": {...}}

# Version 2.0 (New Endpoint)
GET /v2/users/{id}
Response: {"user_id": 123, "full_name": "John Doe", "contact": {"email": "john@example.com"}}
```

## =ÔøΩ Scaling Strategies for L6/L7 Interviews

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling Decision Framework

```markdown
**When to Use Horizontal Scaling:**
 Stateless applications
 Read-heavy workloads
 Predictable traffic patterns
 Cost-sensitive operations
 High availability requirements

**When to Use Vertical Scaling:**

## üèóÔ∏è Complete System Design Walkthrough: URL Shortener

### L6-Level URL Shortener Design (60-Minute Interview)

#### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (10 minutes)

```markdown
**Functional Requirements:**
- Shorten long URLs to 6-7 character codes
- Redirect users when they click shortened URLs
- Custom aliases (optional)
- URL expiration (optional)
- Analytics on click counts

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- 100M URLs created per month
- 100:1 read-to-write ratio (10B redirects per month)
- 99.9% availability
- < 100ms latency for redirects
- 5 years of URL retention

**Scale Estimation:**
- 100M URLs/month = ~40 URLs/second
- 10B redirects/month = ~4000 redirects/second
- Storage: 100M URLs √ó 500 bytes = 50GB per month
- Bandwidth: 4000 RPS √ó 500 bytes = 2MB/s

```

#### Phase 4: Database Design (10 minutes)

```sql
-- Database schema for URL shortener
-- Using PostgreSQL for ACID properties and complex queries

-- Main URLs table
CREATE TABLE urls (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    short_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    long_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    click_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_urls_short_code ON urls(short_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_urls_user_id ON urls(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_urls_created_at ON urls(created_at);

-- Analytics table for detailed click tracking
CREATE TABLE url_clicks (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    short_code VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    clicked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    referrer TEXT,
    country VARCHAR(2),
    city VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Partitioning strategy for analytics table
CREATE TABLE url_clicks_y2024m01 PARTITION OF url_clicks
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

-- Users table (optional, for authenticated users)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    api_key VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    plan_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'free',
    monthly_limit INTEGER DEFAULT 1000
);
```

#### Phase 5: Scaling Strategy (10 minutes)

```markdown
**Scaling Bottlenecks and Solutions:**

1. **Database Write Bottleneck (URL Creation)**
   - Problem: 40 writes/second on single primary
   - Solution: Database sharding by short_code hash
   - Implementation: 16 shards, route by hash(short_code) % 16

2. **Database Read Bottleneck (URL Redirects)**
   - Problem: 4000 reads/second from single database
   - Solution: Read replicas + aggressive caching
   - Implementation: 3 read replicas, 95% cache hit ratio

3. **Cache Layer Scaling**
   - Problem: Redis memory limits and single point of failure
   - Solution: Redis Cluster with automatic failover
   - Implementation: 6 nodes (3 primary + 3 replicas)

4. **Application Layer Scaling**
   - Problem: EC2 instances hitting CPU/memory limits
   - Solution: Auto Scaling Groups with target tracking
   - Implementation: Min 2, Max 20 instances, 70% CPU target
```

‚ùå Not considering data consistency requirements
‚ùå Forgetting about URL validation and security

**Process Mistakes:**
‚ùå Jumping to detailed design without high-level architecture
‚ùå Not asking clarifying questions about scale and requirements
‚ùå Spending too much time on one component
‚ùå Not considering operational aspects (monitoring, deployment)
‚ùå Not justifying technology choices

**Amazon-Specific Mistakes:**
‚ùå Not considering cost optimization strategies
‚ùå Ignoring customer impact of design decisions  
‚ùå Not planning for failure scenarios
‚ùå Overlooking compliance and security requirements
‚ùå Not showing ownership thinking about operations
