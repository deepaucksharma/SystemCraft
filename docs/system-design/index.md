# System Design Mastery for Amazon L6/L7 Interviews

## üèóÔ∏è Architecting at Amazon Scale

System design is the most critical component of Amazon L6/L7 engineering manager interviews. You'll need to demonstrate your ability to architect solutions that handle **hundreds of millions to billions of users**, not theoretical academic exercises.

!!! quote "Real L7 Candidate (December 2024)"
    "System design at L7 level isn't about drawing boxes and arrows‚Äîit's about organizational design, cost optimization, and strategic trade-offs."

## üéØ What Interviewers Evaluate

### Technical Dimensions

| Aspect | What They Look For | Red Flags |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Scale** | Can handle Amazon-scale traffic | Designs for thousands not billions |
| **Reliability** | 99.99% uptime considerations | Ignores failure modes |
| **Performance** | Sub-second latency goals | No performance metrics |
| **Cost** | Cost-effective at scale | Over-engineered solutions |
| **Security** | Defense in depth | Afterthought security |

- How you consider costs (Frugality)
- How you plan for growth (Think Big)

## üìö Core System Design Patterns

### 1. Microservices Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    LB[Load Balancer] --> GW[API Gateway]
    GW --> S1[Service 1]
    GW --> S2[Service 2]
    GW --> S3[Service 3]
    S1 --> DB1[(Database 1)]
    S2 --> DB2[(Database 2)]
    S3 --> Cache[(Redis Cache)]
    S1 --> Q[Message Queue]
    S2 --> Q
```

**When to Use**: Complex systems with independent scaling needs
**Trade-offs**: Complexity vs flexibility
**Amazon Examples**: Most Amazon services

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    P1[Producer 1] --> K[Kinesis Stream]
    P2[Producer 2] --> K
    K --> L1[Lambda 1]
    K --> L2[Lambda 2]
    L1 --> D1[DynamoDB]
    L2 --> S3[S3 Bucket]
    S3 --> A[Athena]
```

**When to Use**: Decoupled, asynchronous processing
**Trade-offs**: Eventual consistency vs real-time
**Amazon Examples**: Order processing, Analytics pipelines

### 3. Cell-Based Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    R[Router] --> C1[Cell 1<br/>Complete Stack]
    R --> C2[Cell 2<br/>Complete Stack]
    R --> C3[Cell 3<br/>Complete Stack]
    
    C1 --> DB1[(DB)]
    C2 --> DB2[(DB)]
    C3 --> DB3[(DB)]
```

**When to Use**: Blast radius reduction
**Trade-offs**: Resource efficiency vs isolation
**Amazon Examples**: S3, Route 53

## üìê System Design Framework

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering (5 minutes)

**Functional Requirements**
- Core features
- User interactions
- Data types

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- Scale (users, requests/sec, data volume)
- Performance (latency, throughput)
- Availability (uptime targets)
- Consistency requirements

**Constraints**
- Budget
- Team size
- Timeline
- Technical constraints

### Step 2: Capacity Estimation (5 minutes)

```python
# Example: Social Media Platform
daily_active_users = 100_000_000
posts_per_user_per_day = 5
average_post_size = 1_000  # bytes
reads_per_write = 100  # read heavy

# Calculate
total_posts_per_day = daily_active_users * posts_per_user_per_day
write_qps = total_posts_per_day / 86400  # ~5,800 writes/sec
read_qps = write_qps * reads_per_write  # ~580,000 reads/sec
daily_storage = total_posts_per_day * average_post_size  # ~500 GB/day
yearly_storage = daily_storage * 365  # ~180 TB/year
```

### Step 3: High-Level Design (15 minutes)

1. Client layer (Web, Mobile, API)

## üìä Common Design Patterns at Scale

### 1. Sharding Strategies

```python
# Consistent Hashing
def get_shard(key, num_shards):
    hash_value = hashlib.md5(key.encode()).hexdigest()
    return int(hash_value, 16) % num_shards

# Range-based Sharding
def get_shard_by_range(value, ranges):
    for i, (start, end) in enumerate(ranges):
        if start <= value < end:
            return i
```

### 2. Caching Patterns

**Cache-Aside**
```python
def get_data(key):
    data = cache.get(key)
    if data is None:
        data = database.get(key)
        cache.set(key, data, ttl=3600)
    return data
```

**Write-Through**
```python
def save_data(key, value):
    cache.set(key, value)
    database.save(key, value)
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

```python
# Token Bucket Algorithm
class TokenBucket:
    def __init__(self, capacity, refill_rate):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.tokens = capacity
        self.refill_rate = refill_rate
        self.last_refill = time.time()
    
    def consume(self, tokens=1):
        self.refill()
        if self.tokens >= tokens:
            self.tokens -= tokens
            return True
        return False
```
