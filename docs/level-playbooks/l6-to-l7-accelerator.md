## The L6 to L7 Reality Check

### The Fundamental Shift

## The Accelerator Tactics

### Tactic 1: The Strategic Project Hijack

```python
def strategic_project_acquisition():
    """
    Legally steal L7-scope projects
    """
    
    opportunity_triggers = {
        "L7_departure": {

        "complexity": "Requires L7 thinking",
        "duration": "6-12 months to show results",
        "ownership": "Clear individual attribution"
